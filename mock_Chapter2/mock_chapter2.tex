    \textbf{\emph{Abstract}}

    Important note about section headings:

In order to get both markdown (notebook) and latex playing ball, I: -
Use heading one in the notebook for Chapter number - Use heading two in
notebook for chapter title - Set chapter heading one block in nbconvert
template file to blank - \ldots{}result = heading ones are ommitted in
latex docs. Latex adds its own titles anyway (this is why I wanted to
sort this).
