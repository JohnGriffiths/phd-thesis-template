 \graphicspath{{mock_Chapter1/}} 

 


    \textbf{\emph{Abstract}}

    Important note about section headings:

In order to get both markdown (notebook) and latex playing ball, I: -
Use heading one in the notebook for Chapter number - Use heading two in
notebook for chapter title - Set chapter heading one block in nbconvert
template file to blank - \ldots{}result = heading ones are ommitted in
latex docs. Latex adds its own titles anyway (this is why I wanted to
sort this).

    Now: the question is - will things be excluded because they are in
markdown cells, of because of the nbconvert template.

Test:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  chapter sub title is current not in html tags and not blocked
\item
  \ldots{}but chapter number is in markdown
\item
  \ldots{}so: should be excluded in markdown
\end{itemize}

1: chapter 1 title and subtitle in heading 1, but chapter 1 number in
html 2 - chapter 1 in title and chapter 2 in subtitute - switch on
suppresion of chapter in nbconvert
