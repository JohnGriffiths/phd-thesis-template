abstract = {Neuronally plausible, generative or forward models are essential for understanding how event-related fields (ERFs) and potentials (ERPs) are generated. In this paper, we present a new approach to modeling event-related responses measured with EEG or MEG. This approach uses a biologically informed model to make inferences about the underlying neuronal networks generating responses. The approach can be regarded as a neurobiologically constrained source reconstruction scheme, in which the parameters of the reconstruction have an explicit neuronal interpretation. Specifically, these parameters encode, among other things, the coupling among sources and how that coupling depends upon stimulus attributes or experimental context. The basic idea is to supplement conventional electromagnetic forward models, of how sources are expressed in measurement space, with a model of how source activity is generated by neuronal dynamics. A single inversion of this extended forward model enables inference about both the spatial deployment of sources and the underlying neuronal architecture generating them. Critically, this inference covers long-range connections among well-defined neuronal subpopulations. In a previous paper, we simulated ERPs using a hierarchical neural-mass model that embodied bottom-up, top-down and lateral connections among remote regions. In this paper, we describe a Bayesian procedure to estimate the parameters of this model using empirical data. We demonstrate this procedure by characterizing the role of changes in cortico-cortical coupling, in the genesis of ERPs. In the first experiment, ERPs recorded during the perception of faces and houses were modeled as distinct cortical sources in the ventral visual pathway. Category-selectivity, as indexed by the face-selective N170, could be explained by category-specific differences in forward connections from sensory to higher areas in the ventral stream. We were able to quantify and make inferences about these effects using conditional estimates of connectivity. This allowed us to identify where, in the processing stream, category-selectivity emerged. In the second experiment, we used an auditory oddball paradigm to show that the mismatch negativity can be explained by changes in connectivity. Specifically, using Bayesian model selection, we assessed changes in backward connections, above and beyond changes in forward connections. In accord with theoretical predictions, there was strong evidence for learning-related changes in both forward and backward coupling. These examples show that category- or context-specific coupling among cortical regions can be assessed explicitly, within a mechanistic, biologically motivated inference framework.},

abstract = {White matter changes have been reported as part of Alzheimer dementia. To investigate this, the total subcortical myelinated nerve fiber length was estimated in postmortem brains from eight females (age 79-88 years) with severe Alzheimer's disease (AD) and compared with brains from 10 female control subjects (age 74-92 years). A stereological method for estimating myelinated brain fibers includes sampling systematically, randomly from the white matter, and counting fibers in unbiased counting frames using light microscopy at approximately 6000x magnification. The diameter of each counted fiber was measured to obtain the diameter distribution of myelinated fibers in both groups. The mean total myelinated fiber length was 81,554 km in the AD group and 78,896 km in the control group (P=0.63). All other measured parameters were also unaffected in the AD brains: The mean fiber length density was 248 km/cm(3) in the AD group and 247 km/cm(3) in the control group; the volume of white matter was 329 cm(3) (AD) and 321 cm(3) (control) and the volume density of myelinated fibers to white matter tissue volume was 0.30 in AD group and 0.31 in the control group. This is the first study of subcortical brain white matter fiber length using a stereological method on postmortem brains from AD patients and control subjects. (C) 2008 IBRO.

abstract = {Individual differences in human intelligence are of interest to a wide range of psychologists and to many people outside the discipline. This overview of contributions to intelligence research covers the first decade of the twenty-first century. There is a survey of some of the major books that appeared since 2000, at different levels of expertise and from different points of view. Contributions to the phenotype of intelligence differences are discussed, as well as some contributions to causes and consequences of intelligence differences. The major causal issues covered concern the environment and genetics, and how intelligence differences are being mapped to brain differences. The major outcomes discussed are health, education, and socioeconomic status. Aging and intelligence are discussed, as are sex differences in intelligence and whether twins and singletons differ in intelligence. More generally, the degree to which intelligence has become a part of broader research in neuroscience, health, and social science is discussed. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Psychology Volume 63 is November 30, 2011. Please see http://www.annualreviews.org/catalog/pubdates.aspx for revised estimates.},

abstract = {Background: The biological process underlying axonal myelination is complex and often prone to injury and disease. The ratio of the inner axonal diameter to the total outer diameter or g-ratio is widely utilized as a functional and structural index of optimal axonal myelination. Based on the speed of fiber conduction, Rushton was the first to derive a theoretical estimate of the optimal g-ratio of 0.6 [1]. This theoretical limit nicely explains the experimental data for myelinated axons obtained for some peripheral fibers but appears significantly lower than that found for CNS fibers. This is, however, hardly surprising given that in the CNS, axonal myelination must achieve multiple goals including reducing conduction delays, promoting conduction fidelity, lowering energy costs, and saving space. Methodology/Principal Findings: In this study we explore the notion that a balanced set-point can be achieved at a functional level as the micro-structure of individual axons becomes optimized, particularly for the central system where axons tend to be smaller and their myelin sheath thinner. We used an intuitive yet novel theoretical approach based on the fundamental biophysical properties describing axonal structure and function to show that an optimal g-ratio can be defined for the central nervous system (approximate to 0.77). Furthermore, by reducing the influence of volume constraints on structural design by about 40\%, this approach can also predict the g-ratio observed in some peripheral fibers (approximate to 0.6). Conclusions/Significance: These results support the notion of optimization theory in nervous system design and construction and may also help explain why the central and peripheral systems have evolved different g-ratios as a result of volume constraints.},

NO ACTUAL CALCULATION OF CONDUCTION VELOCITY IN THIS PAPER
- TABLE OF G-RATIOS SHOWS VARIATION FOR DIFFERENT CNS BRAIN REGIONS - you might want to use this...( but these are for rats, right?)
- Q: should I use 0.77 instead of 0.6? 
- ...Do they cite other evidence saying that the g-ratio in CNS is different to Rushton's cited ranges? (c.f. Ritchie??)
- Check where they get their experimental data from and what the numbers are...
- They justify their model [was it based on PNS info?] as being appropriate for the CNS even though the properties of CNS neurons aren't well known with two references:"...based on thesimilar conduction properties among peripheral and central axons of equivalent caliber [32 = Waxnan \& Swadlow 1976] and their common dependency on the axon’s electrical properties [25 = Shepherd 1999], the structural parameters we used to construct our model (Figure 1) do not seem inappropriate"
- They talk about their 'axon model' 
- I'm not quite sure what that is, and how it relates to other biophysical axon models...
- G-ratio of 0.9 is approaching the theoretical value for spike failure	(you might want to know that for dysconnection considerations)
- experimentally measured g-ratios of central fibers = 0.72-0.81 (Table 1)
- Cite Paus \& Toro [37 = Paus \& Toro 2009] as reporting extremely large (e.g. 10mm) diameter axons in some central systems- ...say that the volume constraint is likely to have been more of an influence on such axons since they inherently already occupy a large volume, giving them their slightly larger g-ratios...

Abstract:
        
        
"Rushton's theoretical limit [of g = 0.6 ] nicely explains the experimental data for myelinated axons obtained for some peripheral fibers but appears significantly lowerthan that found for CNS fibers."
        
        
Axons in the CNS tend to be smaller and their myelin sheath thinner"
        
        
"We used an intuitive yet novel theoretical approach based on the fundamental biophysical properties describing axonal structure and function to show that an optimal g-ratio can be defined for the central nervous system..."},

abstract = {Inter-individual variation in reaction times, and its negative correlation with intelligence, has long been established. Marked intra-individual variability in reaction times, within a given RT paradigm, has also been known for decades but, in contrast, is still unexplained and is usually ignored. Jensen [Jensen, A. R. (1980) Bias in mental testing. New York: Free Press; Jensen, A. R. (1982) Reaction time and psychometric g. In H. J. Eysenck (Ed.), A model for intelligence. Berlin: Springer; Jensen, A. R. (1992) The importance of intraindividual variation in reaction time, Personality and Individual Differences, 13, 869-881.] has proposed an "oscillation model" in which a reaction stimulus-induced evoked potential interacts with "brain waves" (EEG) to make RTs vary from trial to trial within one test session. Anderson [Anderson, B. (1994) Speed of neuron conduction is not the basis of the IQ-RT correlation: Results from a simple neural model, Intelligence, 19, 317-324.] and Anderson and Donaldson [Anderson, B., \& Donaldson, S. (1995) The backpropagation algorithm: Implications for the biological bases of individual differences in intelligence, Intelligence, 21, 327-345.] have used simple computer models of connected neurons and neural nets, respectively, varying the values of certain parameters such as synaptic failure rates, to explain RT variability. I discuss these models and argue that they do not explain the observed variability. A new possible explanation is proposed here: intraindividual RT variability follows from variable (within a S, between individual RT trials) cortical pathway length (CPL), where CPL is the total length of the neural pathways in the cerebral cortex which an RT-induced evoked potential must follow in executing a correct RT response. This is an extension of the inter-individual CPL variability proposed by Reed and Jensen [Reed, T. E., \& Jensen, A. R. (1993) Choice reaction time and visual pathway nerve conduction velocity both correlate with intelligence but appear not to correlate with each other: Implications for information processing, Intelligence, 17, 191-203.] (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

@article{Robinson2003__nonuniform_corticothalamic_continuum_model,
abstract = {Recent theoretical work has successfully predicted electroencephalographic spectra from physiology using a model corticothalamic system with spatially uniform parameters. The present work incorporates parameter nonuniformities into this model via the coupling they induce between spatial eigenmodes. Splitting of the spectral alpha peak, an effect seen in a small percentage of the normal population, is investigated as an illustrative special case. It is confirmed that weak splitting can arise from mode structure if the peak is sufficiently sharp, even for uniform parameters. However, it is further demonstrated that greater splitting can result from nonuniformities, and it is argued that this mechanism for split alpha is better able to account quantitatively for this effect than previously suggested alternatives of pacemakers or purely cortical resonances. On introducing nonuniformities in corticothalamic loop time delays, we find that the alpha frequency also varies as one moves from the front to the back of the head, in accord with observations, and that analogous (but less distinct) variations are seen in the beta peak. Analysis shows realistic variations of around +/-10 ms relative to the mean loop delay of approximately 80 ms can account for observed splittings of about 1 Hz. It is also suggested that subjects who display clear alpha splitting form the tail of a distribution of magnitude of cortical inhomogeneity, rather than a separate population.},

Using mode decomposition techniques, we further derive analytically a low dimensional description of the neural population dynamics and show that the various dynamic behaviors of the entire network can be well reproduced by this reduced system.

@article{Deary2009,
abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Age-associated cognitive decline-or normal (non-pathological, normative, usual) cognitive ageing-is an important human experience which differs in extent between individuals. The determinants of the differences in age-related cognitive decline are not fully understood. Progress in the field is taking place across many areas of biomedical and psychosocial sciences. AREAS OF AGREEMENT AND CONTROVERSY: The phenotype of normal cognitive ageing is well described. Some mental capabilities are well maintained into old age. From early adulthood, there are declines in mental domains such as processing speed, reasoning, memory and executive functions, some of which is underpinned by a decline in a general cognitive factor. There are contributions to understanding individual differences in normal cognitive ageing from genetics, general health and medical disorders such as atherosclerotic disease, biological processes such as inflammation, neurobiological changes, diet and lifestyle. Many of these effect sizes are small; some are poorly replicated; and in some cases, there is the possibility of reverse causation, with prior cognitive ability causing the supposed 'cause' of cognitive ability in old age. EMERGING AREAS FOR DEVELOPING RESEARCH: Genome-wide scans are a likely source to establish genetic contributions. The role of vascular factors in cognitive ageing is increasingly studied and understood. The same applies to diet, biomarkers such as inflammation and lifestyle factors such as exercise. There are marked advances in brain imaging, affording better in vivo studies of brain correlates of cognitive changes. There is growing appreciation that factors affecting general bodily ageing also influence cognitive functions in old age.},

@article{Spearman1915,
abstract = {The present volume appeals to the editor of this series as one of the most significant books, viewed from the standpoint of the future of our educational theory and practice, that has been issued in years. Not only does the volume set forth, in language so simple that the layman can easily understand, the large importance for public education of a careful measurement of the intelligence of children, but it also describes the tests which are to be given and the entire procedure of giving them. In a clear and easy style the author sets forth scientific facts of far-reaching educational importance, facts which it has cost him, his students, and many other scientific workers, years of painstaking labor to accumulate. Only very recently, practically only within the past half-dozen years, have scientific workers begun to appreciate fully the importance of intelligence tests as a guide to educational procedure, and up to the present we have been able to make but little use of such tests in our schools. The conception in itself has been new, and the testing procedure has been more or less unrefined and technical. The following somewhat popular presentation of the idea and of the methods involved, itself based on a scientific monograph which the author is publishing elsewhere, serves for the first time to set forth in simple language the technical details of giving such intelligence tests. The educational significance of the results to be obtained from careful measurements of the intelligence of children can hardly be overestimated. Questions relating to the choice of studies, vocational guidance, schoolroom procedure, the grading of pupils, promotional schemes, the study of the retardation of children in the schools, juvenile delinquency, and the proper handling of subnormals on the one hand and gifted children on the other,all alike acquire new meaning and significance when viewed in the light of the measurement of intelligence as outlined in this volume. As a guide to the interpretation of the results of other forms of investigation relating to the work, progress, and needs of children, intelligence tests form a very valuable aid. More than all other forms of data combined, such tests give the necessary information from which a pupils possibilities of future mental growth can be foretold, and upon which his further education can be most profitably directed. The publication of this revision and extension of the original Binet-Simon scale for measuring intelligence, with the closer adaptation of it to American conditions and needs, should mark a distinct step in advance in our educational procedure. It means the perfection of another and a very important measuring stick for evaluating educational practices, and in particular for diagnosing individual possibilities and needs. Just now the method is new, and its use somewhat limited, but it is the confident prediction of many students of the subject that, before long, intelligence tests will become as much a matter of necessary routine in schoolroom procedure as a blood-count now is in physical diagnosis. That our schoolroom methods will in turn become much more intelligent, and that all classes of children, but especially the gifted and the slow, will profit by such intellectual diagnosis, there can be but little question. That any parent or teacher, without training, can give these tests, the author in no way contends. However, the observations of Dr. Kohs, cited in Chapter VII, as well as the experience of the author and others who have given courses in intelligence testing to teachers, alike indicate that sufficient skill to enable teachers and school principals to give such tests intelligently is not especially difficult to acquire. This being the case it may be hoped that the requisite training to enable them to handle these tests may be included, very soon, as a part of the necessary pedagogical equipment of those who aspire to administrative positions in our public and private schools. Besides being of special importance to school officers and to students of education in colleges and normal schools, this volume can confidently be recommended to physicians and social workers, and to teachers and parents interested in intelligence measurements, as at once the simplest and the best explanation of the newly-evolved intelligence tests, which has so far appeared in print.

abstract = {Researchers often conduct mediation analysis in order to indirectly assess the effect of a proposed cause on some outcome through a proposed mediator. The utility of mediation analysis stems from its ability to go beyond the merely descriptive to a more functional understanding of the relationships among variables. A necessary component of mediation is a statistically and practically significant indirect effect. Although mediation hypotheses are frequently explored in psychological research, formal significance tests of indirect effects are rarely conducted. After a brief overview of mediation, we argue the importance of directly testing the significance of indirect effects and provide SPSS and SAS macros that facilitate estimation of the indirect effect with a normal theory approach and a bootstrap approach to obtaining confidence intervals, as well as the traditional approach advocated by Baron and Kenny (1986). We hope that this discussion and the macros will enhance the frequency of formal mediation tests in the psychology literature. Electronic copies of these macros may be downloaded from the Psychonomic Society's Web archive at www.psychonomic.org/archive/.},

abstract = {Functionally relevant large scale brain dynamics operates within the framework imposed by anatomical connectivity and time delays due to finite transmission speeds. To gain insight on the reliability and comparability of large scale brain network simulations, we investigate the effects of variations in the anatomical connectivity. Two different sets of detailed global connectivity structures are explored, the first extracted from the CoCoMac database and rescaled to the spatial extent of the human brain, the second derived from white-matter tractography applied to diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) for a human subject. We use the combination of graph theoretical measures of the connection matrices and numerical simulations to explicate the importance of both connectivity strength and delays in shaping dynamic behaviour. Our results demonstrate that the brain dynamics derived from the CoCoMac database are more complex and biologically more realistic than the one based on the DSI database. We propose that the reason for this difference is the absence of directed weights in the DSI connectivity matrix.},

abstract = {An electron microscopic analysis has been carried out on the effects of age on the numerical density of both excitatory (asymmetric) and inhibitory (symmetric) synapses in the neuropil of layers 2/3 and of layer 5 in area 46 from the frontal cortex of behaviorally tested rhesus monkeys. There is no change in the lengths of synaptic junctions with age or in the percentage distribution of synapses relative to the postsynaptic spines and dendritic shafts. However, in layers 2/3 there is an overall loss of about 30\% of synapses from 5 to 30 years of age, and both asymmetric and symmetric synapses are lost at the same rate. In layer 5 the situation is different; the overall loss of synapses is only 20\% and this is almost entirely due to a loss of asymmetric synapses, since there is no significant loss of symmetric synapses from this layer with age. When the synapse data are correlated with the overall cognitive impairment shown by the monkeys, it is found that there is a strong correlation between the numerical density of asymmetric synapses in layers 2/3 and cognitive impairment, with a weaker correlation between symmetric synapse loss and cognitive impairment. In layer 5 on the other hand there is no correlation between synapse loss and cognitive impairment. However synapse loss is not the only factor causing cognitive impairment, since in previous studies of area 46 we have found that age-related alteration in myelin in this frontal area also significantly contributes to cognitive decline. The synapse loss is also considered in light of earlier studies, which show that the frequency of spontaneous excitatory synaptic responses is reduced with age in layers 2/3 neurons.

abstract = {Multichannel measurement with hundreds of channels oversamples a curl-free vector field, like the magnetic field in a volume free of sources. This is based on the constraint caused by the Laplace's equation for the magnetic scalar potential; outside of the source volume the signals are spatially band limited. A functional solution of Laplace's equation enables one to separate the signals arising from the sphere enclosing the interesting sources, e.g. the currents in the brain, from the magnetic interference. Signal space separation (SSS) is accomplished by calculating individual basis vectors for each term of the functional expansion to create a signal basis covering all measurable signal vectors. Because the SSS basis is linearly independent for all practical sensor arrangements, any signal vector has a unique SSS decomposition with separate coefficients for the interesting signals and signals coming from outside the interesting volume. Thus, SSS basis provides an elegant method to remove external disturbances. The device-independent SSS coefficients can be used in transforming the interesting signals to virtual sensor configurations. This can also be used in compensating for distortions caused by movement of the object by modeling it as movement of the sensor array around a static object. The device-independence of the decomposition also enables physiological DC phenomena to be recorded using voluntary head movements. When used with properly designed sensor array, SSS does not affect the morphology or the signal-to-noise ratio of the interesting signals.},

abstract = {Despite decades of research, the mechanism by which general anesthetics produce loss of consciousness remains mysterious. A clue may be provided by the evidence that synchronous firing of cortical neurons underlies higher forms of neural processing. In order for these synchrony codes to be precise, transmission time must be independent of path length over all the connected sites between any two cortical areas. Because path lengths vary, developmental mechanisms must compensate for the resulting delay variations. Delay variations could be detected by spike-timing-dependent cues and compensation implemented by systematic changes in axon diameter, myelin thickness, or internodal distance. Anesthetics have been shown to increase conduction velocity in myelinated fibers and may therefore disrupt path-length compensation by changing velocities by different amounts in different types of axon. This simple and testable theory explains why anesthetics interfere selectively with higher cognitive functions but leave those dominated by rate-based firing relatively intact.},

abstract = {This review is concerned with the effects of normal aging on the structure and function of prefrontal area 46 in the rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta). Area 46 has complex connections with somatosensory, visual, visuomotor, motor, and limbic systems and a key role in cognition, which frequently declines with age. An important question is what alterations might account for this decline. We are nowhere near having a complete answer, but as will be shown in this review, it is now evident that there is no single underlying cause. There is no significant loss of cortical neurons and although there are a few senile plaques in rhesus monkey cortex, their frequency does not correlate with cognitive decline. However, as discussed in this review, the following do correlate with cognitive decline. Loss of white matter has been proposed to result in some disconnections between parts of the central nervous system and changes in the structure of myelin sheaths reduce conduction velocity and the timing in neuronal circuits. In addition, there are reductions in the inputs to cortical neurons, as shown by regression of dendritic trees, loss of dendritic spines and synapses, and alterations in transmitters and receptors. These factors contribute to alterations in the intrinsic and network physiological properties of cortical neurons. As more details emerge, it is to be hoped that effective interventions to retard cognitive decline can be proposed. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This article reviews progress and challenges in model driven EEG/fMRI fusion with a focus on brain oscillations. Fusion is the combination of both imaging modalities based on a cascade of forward models from ensemble of post-synaptic potentials (ePSP) to net primary current densities (nPCD) to EEG; and from ePSP to vasomotor feed forward signal (VFFSS) to BOLD. In absence of a model, data driven fusion creates maps of correlations between EEG and BOLD or between estimates of nPCD and VFFS. A consistent finding has been that of positive correlations between EEG alpha power and BOLD in both frontal cortices and thalamus and of negative ones for the occipital region. For model driven fusion we formulate a neural mass EEG/fMRI model coupled to a metabolic hemodynamic model. For exploratory Simulations we show that the Local Linearization (LL) method for integrating stochastic differential equations is appropriate for highly nonlinear dynamics. It has been successfully applied to small and medium sized networks, reproducing the described EEG/BOLD correlations. A new LL-algebraic method allows simulations with hundreds of thousands of neural Populations, with connectivities and conduction delays estimated from diffusion weighted MRI. For parameter and state estimation, Kalman filtering combined with the LL method estimates the innovations or prediction errors. From these the likelihood of models given data are obtained. The LL-innovation estimation method has been already applied to small and medium scale models. With improved Bayesian computations the practical estimation of very large scale EEG/fMRI models shall soon be possible. Hum Brain Mapp 30:2701-2721, 2009. (C) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {Although MEG/EEG signals are highly variable, systematic changes in distinct frequency bands are commonly encountered. These frequency-specific changes represent robust neural correlates of cognitive or perceptual processes (for example, alpha rhythms emerge on closing the eyes). However, their functional significance remains a matter of debate. Some of the mechanisms that generate these signals are known at the cellular level and rest on a balance of excitatory and inhibitory interactions within and between populations of neurons. The kinetics of the ensuing population dynamics determine the frequency of oscillations. In this work we extended the classical nonlinear lumped-parameter model of alpha rhythms, initially developed by Lopes da Silva and colleagues [Kybernetik 15 (1974) 27], to generate more complex dynamics. We show that the whole spectrum of MEG/EEG signals can be reproduced within the oscillatory regime of this model by simply changing the population kinetics. We used the model to examine the influence of coupling strength and propagation delay on the rhythms generated by coupled cortical areas. The main findings were that (1) coupling induces phase-locked activity, with a phase shift of 0 or pi when the coupling is bidirectional, and (2) both coupling and propagation delay are critical determinants of the MEG/EEG spectrum. In forthcoming articles, we will use this model to (1) estimate how neuronal interactions are expressed in MEG/EEG oscillations and establish the construct validity of various indices of nonlinear coupling, and (2) generate event-related transients to derive physiologically informed basis functions for statistical modelling of average evoked responses.

abstract = {In this article, we systematically review the current literature on neural connectivity and dynamics, or equivalently, structure and function. In particular, we discuss how changes in the connectivity of a neural network affect the spatiotemporal network dynamics qualitively. The three major criteria of comparison are, first, the local dynamics at the network nodes which includes fixed point dynamics, oscillatory and chaotic dynamics; second, the presence of time delays via propagation along connecting pathways; and third, the properties of the connectivity matrix such as its statistics, symmetry, and translational invariance. Since the connection topology changes when anatomical scales are traversed, so will the corresponding network dynamics change. As a consequence different types of networks are encountered on different levels of neural organization.},

abstract = {The range of conduction delays between connected neuronal populations is often modeled as a single discrete delay, assumed to be an effective value averaging over all fiber velocities. This paper shows the effects of distributed delays on signal propagation. A distribution acts as a linear filter, imposing an upper frequency cutoff that is inversely proportional to the delay width. Distributed thalamocortical and corticothalamic delays are incorporated into a physiologically based mean-field model of the cortex and thalamus to illustrate their effects on the electroencephalogram (EEG). The power spectrum is acutely sensitive to the width of the thalamocortical delay distribution, and more so than the corticothalamic distribution, because all input signals must travel along the thalamocortical pathway. This imposes a cutoff frequency above which the spectrum is overly damped. The positions of spectral peaks in the resting EEG depend primarily on the distribution mean, with only weak dependences on distribution width. Increasing distribution width increases the stability of fixed point solutions. A single discrete delay successfully approximates a distribution for frequencies below a cutoff that is inversely proportional to the delay width, provided that other model parameters are moderately adjusted. A pair of discrete delays together having the same mean, variance, and skewness as the distribution approximates the distribution over the same frequency range without needing parameter adjustment. Delay distributions with large fractional widths are well approximated by low-order differential equations.},

abstract = {Understanding communication processes is the goal of most communication researchers. Rarely are we satisfied merely ascertaining whether messages have an effect on some outcome of focus in a specific context. Instead, we seek to understand how such effects come to be. What kinds of causal sequences does exposure to a message initiate? What are the causal pathways through which a message exerts its effect? And what role does communication play in the transmission of the effects of other variables over time and space? Numerous communication models attempt to describe the mechanism through which messages or other communication-related variables transmit their effects or intervene between two other variables in a causal model. The communication literature is replete with tests of such models. Over the years, methods used to test such process models have grown in sophistication. An example includes the rise of structural equation modeling (SEM), which allows investigators to examine how well a process model that links some focal variable X to some outcome Y through one or more intervening pathways fits the observed data. Yet frequently, the analytical choices communication researchers make when testing intervening variables models are out of step with advances made in the statistical methods literature. My goal here is to update the field on some of these new advances. While at it, I challenge some conventional wisdom and nudge the field toward a more modern way of thinking about the analysis of intervening variable effects.},

@article{Peters2012b__a_review_of_structural_alterations,
abstract = {Like humans, rhesus monkeys show cognitive decline and this review considers what structural age-related changes underlie this decline. Some structural measures do not alter significantly with age. These include brain weight, overall cortical thickness; numbers of cortical neurons; and numbers of astrocytes and microglial cells. Other structural measures change with age, but the change does not correlate with cognitive decline. These changes include nerve fiber loss from some fiber tracts, degeneration, and regeneration of myelin sheaths, and increase in the frequency of oligodendrocytes. Among the structural measures that increase in frequency with age and also correlate with cognitive decline are the increased frequency of degenerating myelin sheaths and a loss of nerve fibers from some fiber tracts; and the loss of synapses and dendritic spines from upper layers of prefrontal cortex. Consequently, the existing data suggest that cognitive decline correlates with changes in myelinated nerve fibers and with disconnections between and within cortical areas, as reflected by the age-related loss of synapses and of dendritic spines from some cortical areas.},

abstract = {The optic nerve is a circumscribed white matter tract consisting of myelinated nerve fibers and neuroglial cells. Previous work has shown that during normal aging in the rhesus monkey, many optic nerves lose some of their nerve fibers, and in all old optic nerves there are both myelin abnormalities and degenerating nerve fibers. The present study assesses how the neuroglial cell population of the optic nerve is affected by age. To address this question, optic nerves from young (4-10 years) and old (27-33 years) rhesus monkeys were examined by using both light and electron microscopy. It was found that with age the astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia all develop characteristic cytoplasmic inclusions. The astrocytes hypertrophy and fill space vacated by degenerated nerve fibers, and they often develop abundant glial filaments in their processes. Oligodendrocytes and microglial cells both become more numerous with age, and microglial cells often become engorged with phagocytosed debris. Some of the debris can be recognized as degenerating myelin, and in general, the greater the loss of nerve fibers, the more active the microglial cells become. J. Comp. Neurol. 445:13-28, 2002.

abstract = {Limitations of traditional magnetoencephalography (MEG) exclude some important patient groups from MEG examinations, such as epilepsy patients with a vagus nerve stimulator, patients with magnetic particles on the head or having magnetic dental materials that cause severe movement-related artefact signals. Conventional interference rejection methods are not able to remove the artefacts originating this close to the MEG sensor array. For example, the reference array method is unable to suppress interference generated by sources closer to the sensors than the reference array, about 20-40 cm. The spatiotemporal signal space separation method proposed in this paper recognizes and removes both external interference and the artefacts produced by these nearby sources, even on the scalp. First, the basic separation into brain-related and external interference signals is accomplished with signal space separation based on sensor geometry and Maxwell's equations only. After this, the artefacts from nearby sources are extracted by a simple statistical analysis in the time domain, and projected out. Practical examples with artificial current dipoles and interference sources as well as data from real patients demonstrate that the method removes the artefacts without altering the field patterns of the brain signals.},

@article{Alexander2010__orientionally_invariant,
abstract = {This paper proposes and tests a technique for imaging orientationally invariant indices of axon diameter and density in white matter using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging. Such indices potentially provide more specific markers of white matter microstructure than standard indices from diffusion tensor imaging. Orientational invariance allows for combination with tractography and presents new opportunities for mapping brain connectivity and quantifying disease processes. The technique uses a four-compartment tissue model combined with an optimized multishell high-angular-resolution pulsed-gradient-spin-echo acquisition. We test the method in simulation, on fixed monkey brains using a preclinical scanner and on live human brains using a clinical 3T scanner. The human data take about one hour to acquire. The simulation experiments show that both monkey and human protocols distinguish distributions of axon diameters that occur naturally in white matter. We compare the axon diameter index with the mean axon diameter weighted by axon volume. The index differs from this mean and is protocol dependent, but correlation is good for the monkey protocol and weaker, but discernible, for the human protocol where greater diffusivity and lower gradient strength limit sensitivity to only the largest axons. Maps of axon diameter and density indices from the monkey and human data in the corpus callosum and corticospinal tract reflect known trends from histology. The results show orientationally invariant sensitivity to natural axon diameter distributions for the first time with both specialist and clinical hardware. This demonstration motivates further refinement, validation, and evaluation of the precise nature of the indices and the influence of potential confounds.},

- Thought: So 'higher level' areas pack more densely with small axons because they favour quantity of information over speed...
- but does that imply that they would use rate coding rather than temporal coding? [which you might suspect would be used for more complex representations; same goes for synchrony; c.f. Swindale for this argument in relation to anaesthesia]
        
        
...Also: does that mean that higher level areas are going to be most susceptible to age-related axon loss, because it's the small axons that die first?
...[which would give them a higher mean diameter....]
        
        
                                                                Section by section:
Abstract:
        
                "The technique uses a four-compartment tissue model combined with an optimized multishell high-angular-resolution pulsed-gradient-spin-echo acquisition"
        
        
"The human data take about one hour to acquire"
        
"We compare the axon diameter index with the mean axon diameter weighted by axon volume. 
        
The index differs from this mean and is protocol dependent , but correlation is good for the monkey protocol and weaker, but discernible, for the human protocol where greater diffusivity and lower gradient strength limit sensitivity to only the largest axons."
        
                                                        Introduction: 
        
                                "Axon diameter determines conduction velocity (Ritchie, 1982)."
                                        - ...Well that's not entirely true, is it...
        
"Small-diameter axons, for example, in the genu, pack more densely allowing fibre bundles to carry more diverse information between higher processing areas that favour quantity of information over transmission speed (Ptito, 2003; Aboitiz et al., 1992a; Lamantia and Rakic, 1990)."
        
        
"Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) (Basser et al., 1994) models the distribution of particle displacements with a Gaussian distribution"
        
"...size and packing density of cells, the permeability of cell walls and membranes, and the distribution of orientations of anisotropic cells all affect the mean diffusivity and anisotropy."
        
"Hence, a change in these statistics is difficult to associate with specific changes in tissue microstructure."
        
                        "Stanisz et al. (1997) model bovine optic nerve tissue as a three-compartment system with one population of water inside elongated ellipsoidal axons, another inside spherical glial cells, and a third in the extracellular space."
        
        "...Each compartment has its own dimensions, volume fraction, membrane permeability, and internal diffusivity and relaxivity."
        
"...Estimates of the cell sizes and densities agree with manual estimates from microscope images of the same samples. Permeability, diffusivity, and relaxivity estimates are all sensible but unvalidated."
        
                        "The simpler CHARMED model (Assaf et al., 2004, 2008; Assaf and Basser, 2005) has only two compartments: impermeable, parallel cylindrical axons in a homogeneous extracellular space. 
        
Each compartment has its own diffusivity, but relaxation times are the same in both."
        
        "The axon diameter parameters of the model are fixed during fitting, and the acquisition protocol uses only a single diffusion time, so it is not designed to support such an estimate." 
        
"The volume fraction estimates may correlate with axon density, but a true axon density estimate requires knowledge of the axon diameters."
        
                        Several limitations prevent direct translation of these techniques to whole-brain mapping in live human subjects:
        
1. Gradient strengths are an order of magnitude too high
(Stanisz \& Assaf 2008 = |G|max \~{} 1Tm\^{}-1; Barazany = 300 mTm\^{}-1. Current limits in human systems = between 40 \& 80 mTm\^{}-1)
        
        
2. Acquisition time is too long
                                (Assaf 2008 = 1 day; Barazany = 2 hrs)
        
        
3. Prior knowledge of fibre orientation is required.
                                Alexander (2008) used simulations with a simplified (single diameter) CHARMED model to find the optimal combination of gradient strength |G|, pulse width $\delta$, and separation $\Delta$ in a PGSE acquisition.
        
        
The best combination of number of shells vs. number of measurements is found (with no. of directions held fixed), which is found to be gives 3-4 shells 
        
                "posterior distributions on single axon-diameters have low variance when the true diameter is between 10 and 40 $\mu$m. However, posterior distributions for true diameters between 2 and 4 $\mu$m are all similar and close to uniform over the range 0 to 5 $\mu$m. The result suggests that axon diameters of about 5 $\mu$m or less are indistinguishable fromone another, although they are identifiable as small compared to diameters greater than 5 $\mu$m. Diameters over 5 $\mu$m (up to around 40 $\mu$m) can be identified more precisely."
        
Longer T2 gives greater sensitivity to larger axons because it is increasing diffusion time.
        
                        Differences from Alexander (2008):
        
        
(i) slightly improved a priori parameter settings for the experiment design optimization;
(ii) an additional CSF compartment, as in Barazany et al. (2009), and an isotropically restricting compartment, similar to Stanisz et al. (1997),in the model; 
(iii) grid search and gradient descent stages in the fitting procedure to initialize the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC).
        
Differences from CHARMED:
(i) simplification of the two-compartment CHARMED model and inclusion of the CSF and isotropically restricting compartments; (ii) estimation of the axon diameter; 
(iii) optimized, rather than ad hoc, experiment design that explores all possible PGSE combinations; 
(iv) the Bayesian parameter estimation. 
        
Differences from Stanisze \& AxCaliber:
(i) orientational invariance, 
(ii) the model adaptations, 
(iii) the optimized experiment design, 
(iv) the Bayesian estimation, and 
(v) single summary statistic ('axon diameter index') rather than a model of the full axon diameter distribution

@article{Pelletier2002,
abstract = {Much data indicate that the perirhinal (PRH) cortex plays a critical role in declarative memory and that the amygdala facilitates this process under emotionally arousing conditions. However, assuming that the amygdala does so by promoting Hebbian interactions in the PRH cortex is hard to reconcile with the fact that variable distances separate amygdala neurons from their PRH projection sites. Indeed, to achieve a synchronized activation of distributed PRH sites, amygdala axons should display a uniform range of conduction times, irrespective of distance to target. To determine if amygdala axons meet this condition, we measured the antidromic response latencies of lateral amygdala (LA) neurons to electrical stimuli delivered at various rostrocaudal levels of the PRH cortex in cats anesthetized with isoflurane. Although large variations in antidromic response latencies were observed, they were unrelated to the distance between the PRH stimulation sites and LA neurons. To determine whether this result was an artifact due to current spread, two control experiments were performed. First, we examined the antidromic response latency of intrinsic PRH neurons. Although we used the same methods as in the first experiment, the antidromic response latency of PRH neurons to electrical stimuli applied in the PRH cortex increased linearly with the distance between the stimulating and recording sites. Second, we measured the antidromic response latency of PRH neurons projecting to the LA. In this pathway, we also found a statistically significant correlation between conduction times and distance to target. Thus these results support the intriguing possibility that the conduction velocity and/or trajectory of LA axons are adjusted to compensate for variations in distance between the LA and distinct rostrocaudal PRH sites. We hypothesize that because of their uniform range of conduction times to the PRH cortex, LA neurons can generate short time windows of depolarization facilitating Hebbian associations between coincident, but spatially distributed, activity patterns in the PRH cortex. In this context, the temporal scatter of conduction times in the LA to PRH pathway is conceived as a mechanism used to lengthen the period of depolarization to compensate for conduction delays within intrinsic PRH pathways. In part, this mechanism might explain how the amygdala promotes memory storage in emotionally arousing conditions.},

abstract = {Research on the spatio-temporal dynamics of visual object recognition suggests a recurrent, interactive model whereby an initial feedforward sweep through the ventral stream to prefrontal cortex is followed by recurrent interactions. However, critical questions remain regarding the factors that mediate the degree of recurrent interactions necessary for meaningful object recognition. The novel prediction we test here is that recurrent interactivity is driven by increasing semantic integration demands as defined by the complexity of semantic information required by the task and driven by the stimuli. To test this prediction, we recorded magnetoencephalography data while participants named living and nonliving objects during two naming tasks. We found that the spatio-temporal dynamics of neural activity were modulated by the level of semantic integration required. Specifically, source reconstructed time courses and phase synchronization measures showed increased recurrent interactions as a function of semantic integration demands. These findings demonstrate that the cortical dynamics of object processing are modulated by the complexity of semantic information required from the visual input.},

abstract = {Cortical analysis related to visual object recognition is traditionally thought to propagate serially along a bottom-up hierarchy of ventral areas. Recent proposals gradually promote the role of top-down processing in recognition, but how such facilitation is triggered remains a puzzle. We tested a specific model, proposing that low spatial frequencies facilitate visual object recognition by initiating top-down processes projected from orbitofrontal to visual cortex. The present study combined magnetoencephalography, which has superior temporal resolution, functional magnetic resonance imaging, and a behavioral task that yields successful recognition with stimulus repetitions. Object recognition elicited differential activity that developed in the left orbitofrontal cortex 50 ms earlier than it did in recognition-related areas in the temporal cortex. This early orbitofrontal activity was directly modulated by the presence of low spatial frequencies in the image. Taken together, the dynamics we revealed provide strong support for the proposal of how top-down facilitation of object recognition is initiated, and our observations are used to derive predictions for future research.},

abstract = {Alterations in neuronal morphology occur in primate cerebral cortex during normal aging, vary depending on the neuronal type, region and cortical layer, and have been related to memory and cognitive impairment. We analyzed how such changes affect a specific subpopulation of cortical neurons forming long corticocortical projections from the superior temporal cortex to prefrontal area 46. These neurons were identified by retrograde transport in young and old macaque monkeys. Dendritic arbors of retrogradely labeled neurons were visualized in brain slices by intracellular injection of Lucifer Yellow, and reconstructed three-dimensionally using computer-assisted morphometry. Total dendritic length, numbers of segments, numbers of spines, and spine density were analyzed in layer III pyramidal neurons forming the projection considered. Sholl analysis was used to determine potential age-related changes in dendritic complexity. We observed statistically significant age-related decreases in spine numbers and density on both apical and basal dendritic arbors in these projection neurons. On apical dendrites, changes in spine numbers occurred mainly on the proximal dendrites but spine density decreased uniformly among the different branch orders. On basal dendrites, spine numbers and density decreased preferentially on distal branches. Regressive dendritic changes were observed only in one particular portion of the apical dendrites, with the general dendritic morphology and extent otherwise unaffected by aging. In view of the fact that there is no neuronal loss in neocortex and hippocampus in old macaque monkeys, it is possible that the memory and cognitive decline known to occur in these animals is related to rather subtle changes in the morphological and molecular integrity of neurons subserving identifiable neocortical association circuits that play a critical role in cognition.},

abstract = {The complexity of cortical circuits may be characterized by the number of synapses per neuron. We study the dependence of complexity on the fraction of the cortical volume that is made up of "wire" (that is, of axons and dendrites), and find that complexity is maximized when wire takes up about 60\% of the cortical volume. This prediction is in good agreement with experimental observations. A consequence of our arguments is that any rearrangement of neurons that takes more wire would sacrifice computational power.},

A total of 147 postsecondary students were tested for nonverbal IQ and latency of the P100 (a visually evoked potential recorded over the primary visual cortex); this latency was used to estimate an approximate NCV in the visual pathway (retina to visual cortex). The correlation between this NCV and IQ is +.26 (p = .002); after correction for the restricted IQ range (but not for test ceiling or attenuation), it is +.37. Three recent studies of mentally retarded patients, using similar stimulation and recording, also showed increased P100 latencies relative to controls. These results, plus those of other IQ studies using choice reaction time or long-latency evoked potentials, are all explainable by positive correlations between brain NCV and speed of information processing and between this speed and intelligence level.},

Using a 2‐index presentation strategy, which includes using the maximum likelihood (ML)‐based standardized root mean squared residual (SRMR) and supplementing it with either Tucker‐Lewis Index (TLI), Bollen's (1989) Fit Index (BL89), Relative Noncentrality Index (RNI), Comparative Fit Index (CFI), Gamma Hat, McDonald's Centrality Index (Mc), or root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA), various combinations of cutoff values from selected ranges of cutoff criteria for the ML‐based SRMR and a given supplemental fit index were used to calculate rejection rates for various types of true‐population and misspecified models; that is, models with misspecified factor covariance(s) and models with misspecified factor loading(s). The results suggest that, for the ML method, a cutoff value close to .95 for TLI, BL89, CFI, RNI, and Gamma Hat; a cutoff value close to .90 for Mc; a cutoff value close to .08 for SRMR; and a cutoff value close to .06 for RMSEA are needed before we can conclude that there is a relatively good fit between the hypothesized model and the observed data. Furthermore, the 2‐index presentation strategy is required to reject reasonable proportions of various types of true‐population and misspecified models. Finally, using the proposed cutoff criteria, the ML‐based TLI, Mc, and RMSEA tend to overreject true‐population models at small sample size and thus are less preferable when sample size is small.},

abstract = {Brain activity can be measured with several non-invasive neuroimaging modalities, but each modality has inherent limitations with respect to resolution, contrast and interpretability. It is hoped that multimodal integration will address these limitations by using the complementary features of already available data. However, purely statistical integration can prove problematic owing to the disparate signal sources. As an alternative, we propose here an advanced neural population model implemented on an anatomically sound cortical mesh with freely adjustable connectivity, which features proper signal expression through a realistic head model for the electroencephalogram (EEG), as well as a haemodynamic model for functional magnetic resonance imaging based on blood oxygen level dependent contrast (fMRI BOLD). It hence allows simultaneous and realistic predictions of EEG and fMRI BOLD from the same underlying model of neural activity. As proof of principle, we investigate here the influence on simulated brain activity of strengthening visual connectivity. In the future we plan to fit multimodal data with this neural population model. This promises novel, model-based insights into the brain's activity in sleep, rest and task conditions.},

abstract = {The core of human language, which differentiates it from the communicative abilities of other species, is the set of combinatorial operations called syntax. For over a century researchers have attempted to understand how this essential function is organized in the brain. Here, we combine behavioral and neuroimaging methods, with left hemisphere-damaged patients and healthy controls, to identify the pathways connecting the brain regions involved in syntactic processing. In a previous functional magnetic resonance imaging study (Tyler LK, Wright P, Randall B, Marslen-Wilson WD, Stamatakis EA. 2010b. Reorganization of syntactic processing following left-hemisphere brain damage: does right-hemisphere activity preserve function? Brain. 133(11):3396-3408.), we established that regions of left inferior frontal cortex and left posterior middle temporal cortex were activated during syntactic processing. These clusters were used here as seeds for probabilistic tractography analyses in patients and controls, allowing us to delineate, and measure the integrity of, the white matter tracts connecting the frontal and temporal regions active for syntax. We found that structural disconnection in either of 2 fiber bundles--the arcuate fasciculus or the extreme capsule fiber system--was associated with syntactic impairment in patients. The results demonstrate the causal role in syntactic analysis of these 2 major left hemisphere fiber bundles--challenging existing views about their role in language functions and providing a new basis for future research in this key area of human cognition.},

Regions of the sensorimotor cortex that were activated secondary to hand movement were identified using functional MRI methodology (FMRI). Time courses of low frequency (< 0.1 Hz) fluctuations in resting brain were observed to have a high degree of temporal correlation (P < 10(-3)) within these regions and also with time courses in several other regions that can be associated with motor function. It is concluded that correlation of low frequency fluctuations, which may arise from fluctuations in blood oxygenation or flow, is a manifestation of functional connectivity of the brain.},

abstract = {It has been suggested that the dysfunction of the prefrontal cortex in schizophrenics is due to dysfunctional connections between the prefrontal cortex and more posterior structures. The present study uses a recent stereological method that allows quantitation of the myelinated nerve fibers in the brain white matter. As especially the prefrontal region is of interest in schizophrenics, the prefrontal white matter was quantitated separately. The total length of nerve fibers in post-mortem brains was estimated from eight male chronic schizophrenics and nine male controls (age-range: 40-81 years). Samples were taken systematically and randomly from both the entire white matter and selectively from the prefrontal white matter. The biopsies were rotated randomly before sectioning to avoid bias due to the anisotropic nature of nerve fibers. The fibers were counted at light microscopic level at about 10,000x magnification and the fiber diameter of each counted fiber was measured to get the size distribution of the fibers. The schizophrenics had a total of 129,000 km myelinated fibers in the white matter and 25,700 km in the prefrontal white matter, which was non-significantly different from a total of 137,000 kin in the entire white matter and 27,600 km in the prefrontal white matter in controls. The size distribution of the fibers in schizophrenics was within normal limits compared to controls. Our results do not show a larger loss of nerve fibers in neither the white matter globally or in the prefrontal white matter of schizophrenics. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Nonlinear equations are introduced to model the behavior of the waves of cortical electrical activity that are responsible for signals observed in electroencephalography. These equations incorporate nonlinearities, axonal and dendritic lags, excitatory and inhibitory neuronal populations, and the two-dimensional nature of the cortex, while rendering nonlinear features far more tractable than previous formulations, both analytically and numerically. The model equations are first used to calculate steady-state levels of cortical activity for various levels of stimulation. Dispersion equations for linear waves are then derived analytically and an analytic expression is found for the linear stability boundary beyond which a seizure will occur. The effects of boundary conditions in determining global eigenmodes are also studied in various geometries and the corresponding eigenfrequencies are found. Numerical results confirm the analytic ones, which are also found to reproduce existing results in the relevant limits, thereby elucidating the limits of validity of previous approximations.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The physiological basis for the changes in auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) during development and aging is currently unknown. This study investigates age- and task-related changes via a mathematical model of neuronal activity, which allows a number of physiological changes to be inferred. METHODS: A quantitative, physiology-based model of activity in cortical and thalamic neurons was used to analyze oddball AEPs recorded from 1498 healthy subjects aged 6-86 years. RESULTS: Differences between standard and target responses can be largely explained by differences in connection strengths between thalamic and cortical neurons. The time it takes signals to travel between the thalamus and cortex decreases during development and increases during aging. Strong age trends are also seen in intracortical and thalamocortical neuronal connection strengths. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in AEP latency can be attributed to changes in the thalamocortical signal propagation time. Large changes in the connection strengths between neuronal populations occur during development, resulting in increased thalamocortical inhibition and decreased thalamocortical excitation. Standard and target parameters are similar in children but diverge during adolescence, due to changes in thalamocortical loop activity. SIGNIFICANCE: Model-based AEP analysis links age-related changes in brain electrophysiology to underlying changes in brain anatomy and physiology, and yields quantitative predictions of several currently unknown physiological and anatomical properties of the brain.},

abstract = {Bimanual coordination engages a distributed network of brain areas, the spatiotemporal organization of which has given rise to intense debates. Do bimanual movements require information processing in the same set of brain areas that are engaged by movements of the individual components (left and right hands)? Or is it necessary that other brain areas are recruited to help in the act of coordination? These two possibilities are often considered as mutually exclusive, with studies yielding support for one or the other depending on techniques and hypotheses. However, as yet there is no account of how the two views may work together dynamically. Using the method of Mode-Level Cognitive Subtraction (MLCS) on high density EEG recorded during unimanual and bimanual movements, we expose spatiotemporal reorganization of large-scale cortical networks during stable inphase and antiphase coordination and transitions between them. During execution of stable bimanual coordination patterns, neural dynamics were dominated by temporal modulation of unimanual networks. At instability and transition, there was evidence for recruitment of additional areas. Our study provides a framework to quantify large-scale network mechanisms underlying complex cognitive tasks often studied with macroscopic neurophysiological recordings.},

Aging 29, 1547-1555) presented a model that suggests a specific age-related effect of white matter integrity on working memory. We illustrate potential pitfalls of structural equation modelling by criticizing their model for (a) its neglect of latent variables, (b) its complexity, (c) its questionable causal assumptions, (d) the use of empirical model reduction, (e) the mix-up of theoretical perspectives, and (f) the failure to compare alternative models. We show that a more parsimonious model, based solely on the well-established general factor of cognitive ability, fits their data at least as well. Importantly, when modelled this way there is no support for a role of white matter integrity in cognitive aging in this sample, indicating that their conclusion is strongly dependent on how the data are analysed. We suggest that evidence from more conclusive study designs is needed.},

abstract = {In this review, the authors summarize the literature on brain morphological changes that occur throughout the human life span from childhood into old age. They examine changes observed postmortem and in vivo where various brain MRI analytic methods have been applied. They evaluate brain changes observed with volumetric image analytic methods and voxel-based morphometric methods that may be used to better localize where changes occur. The primary focus of the review is on recent studies using state-of-the-art cortical pattern-matching techniques to assess age-related changes in cortical asymmetries, gray matter distribution, and brain growth across various age spans. The authors attempt to integrate findings from the in vivo studies with results from postmortem studies and analyze the complicated question of when brain maturation stops and brain aging begins. Analyzing the regional patterns of change initiated at various ages may help elucidate relationships between changing brain morphology and changing cognitive functions that occur throughout life. Long-range longitudinal studies, correlations between imaging and postmortem data, and more advanced image acquisition and analysis technologies will be needed to fully interpret brain morphological changes observed in vivo in relation to development and aging.},

abstract = {Magnetic interference signals often hamper analysis of magnetoencephalographic (MEG) measurements. Artifact sources in the proximity of the sensors cause strong and spatially complex signals that are particularly challenging for the existing interference-suppression methods. Here we demonstrate the performance of the temporally extended signal space separation method (tSSS) in removing strong interference caused by external and nearby sources on auditory-evoked magnetic fields-the sources of which are well established. The MEG signals were contaminated by normal environmental interference, by artificially produced additional external interference, and by nearby artifacts produced by a piece of magnetized wire in the subject's lip. After tSSS processing, even the single-trial auditory responses had a good-enough signal-to-noise ratio for detailed waveform and source analysis. Waveforms and source locations of the tSSS-reconstructed data were in good agreement with the responses from the control condition without extra interference. Our results demonstrate that tSSS is a robust and efficient method for removing a wide range of different types of interference signals in neuromagnetic multichannel measurements.},

abstract = {The brains of large mammals have lower rates of metabolism than those of small mammals, but the functional consequences of this scaling are not well understood. An attractive target for analysis is axons, whose size, speed and energy consumption are straightforwardly related. Here we show that from shrews to whales, the composition of white matter shifts from compact, slow-conducting, and energetically expensive unmyelinated axons to large, fast-conducting, and energetically inexpensive myelinated axons. The fastest axons have conduction times of 1-5 ms across the neocortex and <1 ms from the eye to the brain, suggesting that in select sets of communicating fibers, large brains reduce transmission delays and metabolic firing costs at the expense of increased volume. Delays and potential imprecision in cross-brain conduction times are especially great in unmyelinated axons, which may transmit information via firing rate rather than precise spike timing. In neocortex, axon size distributions can account for the scaling of per-volume metabolic rate and suggest a maximum supportable firing rate, averaged across all axons, of 7 +/- 2 Hz. Axon size distributions also account for the scaling of white matter volume with respect to brain size. The heterogeneous white matter composition found in large brains thus reflects a metabolically constrained trade-off that reduces both volume and conduction time.},

abstract = {Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measures diffusion of molecular water, which can be used to calculate indices of white matter integrity. Early DTI studies of aging primarily focused on two global measures of integrity; the average rate (mean diffusivity, MD) and orientation coherence (fractional anisotropy, FA) of diffusion. More recent studies have added measures of water movement parallel (axial diffusivity, AD) and perpendicular (radial diffusivity, RD) to the primary diffusion direction, which are thought to reflect the neural bases of age differences in diffusion (i.e., axonal shrinkage and demyelination, respectively). In this study, patterns of age differences in white matter integrity were assessed by comparing younger and healthy older adults on multiple measures of integrity (FA, AD, and RD). Results revealed two commonly reported patterns (Radial Increase Only and Radial/Axial Increase), and one relatively novel pattern (Radial Increase/Axial Decrease) that varied by brain region and may reflect differential aging of microstructural (e.g., degree of myelination) and macrostructural (e.g., coherence of fiber orientation) properties of white matter. In addition, larger age differences in FA in frontal white matter were consistent with the anterior-posterior gradient of age differences in white matter integrity. Together, these findings complement other recent studies in providing information about patterns of diffusivity that are characteristic of healthy aging.},

abstract = {The relationship of speed-of-information-processing (SIP), as derived from reaction times (RTs) on experimental tasks, and intelligence has been extensively studied. SIP is suggested to measure the efficiency with which subjects can perform basic cognitive operations underlying a wide range of intellectual abilities. Observed phenotypic correlations between RT and IQ typically are in the -0.2 to -0.4 range, and the question is addressed to what extent this relationship is determined by genetic or environmental influences. In a group of Dutch twins the heritabilities for RT tasks at age 16 and 18 years were estimated longitudinally and the nature of the RT-IQ relationship was investigated. At age 16 years heritabilities for a simple reaction time (SRT) and choice reaction time (CRT) were 64 and 62\% and the average phenotypic correlations between the RTs and IQ, assessed by the Raven standard progressive matrices, was -0.21. At the second test occasion lower heritabilities were observed for the RTs, probably due to modifications in administration procedures. The mean correlations between the RTs and WAIS verbal and per formal subtests were -0.18 and -0.16. Multivariate genetic analyses at both ages showed that the RT-IQ correlations were explained by genetic influences. These results are in agreement with earlier findings (Baker et al., Behav Genet 1991;21:351-67; Ho et al., Behav Genet 1988;18:247-61) and support the existence of a common, heritable biological basis underlying the SIP-IQ relationship.},

abstract = {Cortical neurons exhibit tremendous variability in the number and temporal distribution of spikes in their discharge patterns. Furthermore, this variability appears to be conserved over large regions of the cerebral cortex, suggesting that it is neither reduced nor expanded from stage to stage within a processing pathway. To investigate the principles underlying such statistical homogeneity, we have analyzed a model of synaptic integration incorporating a highly simplified integrate and fire mechanism with decay. We analyzed a "high-input regime" in which neurons receive hundreds of excitatory synaptic inputs during each interspike interval. To produce a graded response in this regime, the neuron must balance excitation with inhibition. We find that a simple integrate and fire mechanism with balanced excitation and inhibition produces a highly variable interspike interval, consistent with experimental data. Detailed information about the temporal pattern of synaptic inputs cannot be recovered from the pattern of output spikes, and we infer that cortical neurons are unlikely to transmit information in the temporal pattern of spike discharge. Rather, we suggest that quantities are represented as rate codes in ensembles of 50-100 neurons. These column-like ensembles tolerate large fractions of common synaptic input and yet covary only weakly in their spike discharge. We find that an ensemble of 100 neurons provides a reliable estimate of rate in just one interspike interval (10-50 msec), Finally we derived an expression for the variance of the neural spike count that leads to a stable propagation of signal and noise in networks of neurons-that is, conditions that do not impose an accumulation or diminution of noise. The solution implies that single neurons perform simple algebra resembling averaging, and that more sophisticated computations arise by virtue of the anatomical convergence of novel combinations of inputs to the cortical column from external sources.},

Nevertheless, the constraints on fast interhemispheric communication in large-brained species can somehow contribute to the development of ipsilateral, intrahemispheric networks, which might promote the development of brain lateralization.},

abstract = {The insulative properties of myelin sheaths in the central and peripheral nervous systems (CNS and PNS) are widely thought to derive from the high resistance and low capacitance of the constituent membranes. Although this view adequately accounts for myelin function in large diameter fibers, it poorly reflects the behavior of small fibers that are prominent in many regions of the CNS. Herein, we develop a computational model to more accurately represent conduction in small fibers. By incorporating structural features that, hitherto, have not been simulated, we demonstrate that myelin tight junctions (TJs) improve saltatory conduction by reducing current flow through the myelin, limiting axonal membrane depolarization and restraining the activation of ion channels beneath the myelin sheath. Accordingly, our simulations provide a novel view of myelin by which TJs minimize charging of the membrane capacitance and lower the membrane time constant to improve the speed and accuracy of transmission in small diameter fibers. This study establishes possible mechanisms whereby TJs affect conduction in the absence of overt perturbations to myelin architecture and may in part explain the tremor and gait abnormalities observed in Claudin 11-null mice.},

abstract = {A detailed morphometric study was performed on sural nerve biopsies to determine the consistency of sensory nerve pathology in amyotrophic lateral slcerosis (ALS) and to seek a correlation between the severity of peripheral nerve pathology and disease duration.  Nerve biopsies from patients with ALS consistently showed evidence of early axonal atrophy, increased remylination and a shift in the diameter distributions curve towards smaller fiber diameters.  Importantly, the severity of sensory nerve pathlogy in ALS patients correlated with disease duration.  The peripheral nerve sodium pump concentration of patients was not reduced.  It is concluded that an ingravescent dorsal root ganglion neuronopathy is seen in the incipient stages of ALS, preferentially affecting the largest neurons and resulting in turn in progressive axonal atrophy, secondary demyelination-remyelination and finally in nerve fiber degeneration.  Etiologically, a parallel involvement of motor and sensory neurons suggests a more widespread metabolic disturbance in ALS than simply "sick" motor neurons.},

abstract = {MRI tractography is the mapping of neural fiber pathways based on diffusion MRI of tissue diffusion anisotropy. Tractography based on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) cannot directly image multiple fiber orientations within a single voxel. To address this limitation, diffusion spectrum MRI (DSI) and related methods were developed to image complex distributions of intravoxel fiber orientation. Here we demonstrate that tractography based on DSI has the capacity to image crossing fibers in neural tissue. DSI was performed in formalin-fixed brains of adult macaque and in the brains of healthy human subjects. Fiber tract solutions were constructed by a streamline procedure, following directions of maximum diffusion at every point, and analyzed in an interactive visualization environment (TrackVis). We report that DSI tractography accurately shows the known anatomic fiber crossings in optic chiasm, centrum semiovale, and brainstem; fiber intersections in gray matter, including cerebellar folia and the caudate nucleus; and radial fiber architecture in cerebral cortex. In contrast, none of these examples of fiber crossing and complex structure was identified by DTI analysis of the same data sets. These findings indicate that DSI tractography is able to image crossing fibers in neural tissue, an essential step toward non-invasive imaging of connectional neuroanatomy.},

abstract = {Impaired motor coordination is a widespread attribute of senescence. As this might be due to slower action potential propagation in peripheral nerves or to prolonged delays of neuromuscular transmission, axon conduction velocity, synaptic delays, and associated morphologic features governing speed of conduction were studied in the phrenic-diaphragm preparations of rats aged 10 (mature adult) and 28 (aged) months. Conduction velocity and synaptic delay of the motoneurons were measured with electrophysiologic recording techniques. Speed of conduction did not change with age, but the average synaptic delay increased from 0.28 in the younger rats to 0.40 ms in the 28-month-old animals. Nerve composition was examined using the electron microscope. There were no age-related changes in the number of myelinated or nonmyelinated axons, capillaries, or myelin sheath invaginations. Moreover, fiber diameter and myelin sheath width did not vary with age. The total extracellular space was about 32\% larger in the aged rats: the synaptic cleft widths were 42.7 and 50.6 nm in the 10- and the 28-month animals, respectively. We concluded that in the rat age-related changes in the transmission properties of peripheral nerve are minor. Furthermore, temporal motor deficits during aging must be associated primarily with changes in central pathways or at the muscular apparatus.},

abstract = {The effects of age on nerve fibers and neuroglial cells in the fornix were examined in 25 rhesus monkeys between 4 and 33 years of age. There is no age-related change in the cross-sectional area of the fornix, but there is a significant loss of myelinated nerve fibers. The loss of myelinated nerve fibers is accompanied by a significant increase in the numbers of nerve fibers that show degeneration of their axons and alterations in myelin sheaths. Aging also brings about an increase in the frequency of profiles of paranodes, indicating that some of the nerve fibers are being remyelinated. Aging also affects neuroglial cells. Each type shows inclusions in their perikarya, and in the case of astrocytes and microglial cells some of these inclusions are phagocytosed myelin. Numbers of astrocytes and microglial cells do not appear to increase with age, but there is a 20\% increase in oligodendrocytes. When correlations with cognitive impairments displayed by individual monkeys are examined, the decreased packing density of nerve fibers and the increasing frequency of nerve fibers with degenerating axons and of nerve fibers with altered myelin sheaths all correlate with increasing cognitive impairment. It is suggested that these correlations result from some disconnection of the hippocampus from the thalamus, septal nuclei, and medial frontal cortex and from reductions in the conduction velocity brought about by the shorter internodal lengths of remyelinated nerve fibers in the fornix.},

They also discuss useful extensions of these strategies, such as how to address hypotheses that involve both mediation and moderation effects. They suggest ways to proceed when theory implies that multiple mediators may intervene between two variables, and explain how to address mediation hypotheses in modeling paradigms other than least squares multiple regression. They describe how a priori consideration of study design, causality, and statistical power contribute to hypothesis tests with sound scientific bases, and suggest ways to quantify effect size to facilitate communication of research findings. Finally, they address some practical software concerns for scientists who wish to undertake the rigorous investigation of hypotheses involving indirect effects.

abstract = {Diffusion imaging and bound pool fraction (BPF) mapping are two quantitative magnetic resonance imaging techniques that measure microstructural features of the white matter of the brain. Diffusion imaging provides a quantitative measure of the diffusivity of water in tissue. BPF mapping is a quantitative magnetization transfer (qMT) technique that estimates the proportion of exchanging protons bound to macromolecules, such as those found in myelin, and is thus a more direct measure of myelin content than diffusion. In this work, we combined BPF estimates of macromolecular content with measurements of diffusivity within human white matter tracts. Within the white matter, the correlation between BPFs and diffusivity measures such as fractional anisotropy and radial diffusivity was modest, suggesting that diffusion tensor imaging and bound pool fractions are complementary techniques. We found that several major tracts have high BPF, suggesting a higher density of myelin in these tracts. We interpret these results in the context of a quantitative tissue model.},

We disentangle conflicting definitions of moderated mediation and describe approaches for estimating and testing a variety of hypotheses involving conditional indirect effects. We introduce standard errors for hypothesis testing and construction of confidence intervals in large samples but advocate that researchers use bootstrapping whenever possible. We also describe methods for probing significant conditional indirect effects by employing direct extensions of the simple slopes method and Johnson-Neyman technique for probing significant interactions. Finally, we provide an SPSS macro to facilitate the implementation of the recommended asymptotic and bootstrapping methods. We illustrate the application of these methods with an example drawn from the Michigan Study of Adolescent Life Transitions, showing that the indirect effect of intrinsic student interest on mathematics performance through teacher perceptions of talent is moderated by student math self-concept.},

This work is principally being conducted along two empirical fronts: genetics--quantitative and molecular--and brain imaging. Quantitative genetic studies have established that there are additive genetic contributions to different aspects of cognitive ability--especially general intelligence--and how they change through the lifespan. Molecular genetic studies have yet to identify reliably reproducible contributions from individual genes. Structural and functional brain-imaging studies have identified differences in brain pathways, especially parieto-frontal pathways, that contribute to intelligence differences. There is also evidence that brain efficiency correlates positively with intelligence.},

abstract = {The effect of age on layer 1 in primary visual cortex was determined in 19 rhesus monkeys of various ages. Twelve of the monkeys had been behaviorally tested. With age layer 1 becomes thinner and the glial limiting membrane becomes thicker. In the neuropil of layer 1 many of the dendrites in old monkeys appear to be degenerating and, as a consequence, electron micrographs from old monkeys display fewer dendritic and spine profiles per unit area than in young monkeys. As determined using both the disector and size-frequency methods, there is also a concomitant decrease in the numerical density of synapses with age. Although there is a significant correlation between the thinning of layer 1 in area 17 and age, there is no significant correlation between either the thinning of layer 1 or its loss of synapses and any of the behavioral measures of memory function obtained from the 12 behaviorally tested monkeys. Similar morphological changes with age occur in layer 1 of prefrontal cortex of these same monkeys, but in area 46 both the thinning of layer 1 and the loss of synapses shaw a significant correlation with behavioral measures of memory function. These differences between layer 1 in these two cortical areas presumably relate to the fact that prefrontal cortex has a greater role in subserving cognition than does primary visual cortex.},

Its aetiology is still poorly understood, although a major breakthrough came with the discovery that mutations in the Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) gene affect approximately 20\% of patients with familial ALS. Experiments using both transgenic mice and ALS tissues have been useful in delineating other genetic defects in ALS. However, because only a subset of cases can be attributed to one particular molecular defect (such as mutation of SOD1 or the gene encoding neurofilament H), the aetiology of ALS is likely to be multifactorial. This review discusses the major mechanisms of neurodegeneration in ALS, such as oxidative stress, glutaminergic excitotoxicity, damage to vital organelles, and aberrant protein aggregation.},

abstract = {Traditionally brain function is studied through measuring physiological responses in controlled sensory, motor, and cognitive paradigms. However, even at rest, in the absence of overt goal-directed behavior, collections of cortical regions consistently show temporally coherent activity. In humans, these resting state networks have been shown to greatly overlap with functional architectures present during consciously directed activity, which motivates the interpretation of rest activity as day dreaming, free association, stream of consciousness, and inner rehearsal. In monkeys, it has been shown though that similar coherent fluctuations are present during deep anesthesia when there is no consciousness. Here, we show that comparable resting state networks emerge from a stability analysis of the network dynamics using biologically realistic primate brain connectivity, although anatomical information alone does not identify the network. We specifically demonstrate that noise and time delays via propagation along connecting fibres are essential for the emergence of the coherent fluctuations of the default network. The spatiotemporal network dynamics evolves on multiple temporal scales and displays the intermittent neuroelectric oscillations in the fast frequency regimes, 1-100 Hz, commonly observed in electroencephalographic and magnetoencephalographic recordings, as well as the hemodynamic oscillations in the ultraslow regimes, <0.1 Hz, observed in functional magnetic resonance imaging. The combination of anatomical structure and time delays creates a space-time structure in which the neural noise enables the brain to explore various functional configurations representing its dynamic repertoire.},

abstract = {Interspike intervals were studied for impulses propagating during the relative refractory or early supernormal periods along axons of visual cortical efferent neurons in the rabbit. Although the impulses were initiated for a range of initial interstimulus intervals, the interspike intervals were locked at a constant value after propagation. This interval (the entrainment interval) corresponded in time to the duration of the refractory period. The spatial and temporal properties of impulse recovery may result in the independence of interspike interval from interstimulus interval after conduction through the relative refractory or early supernormal periods.},

abstract = {Dynamical causal modeling (DCM) of evoked responses is a new approach to making inferences about connectivity changes in hierarchical networks measured with electro- and magnetoencephalography (EEG and MEG). In a previous paper, we illustrated this concept using a lead field that was specified with infinite prior precision. With this prior, the spatial expression of each source area, in the sensors, is fixed. In this paper, we show that using lead field parameters with finite precision enables the data to inform the network's spatial configuration and its expression at the sensors. This means that lead field and coupling parameters can be estimated simultaneously. Alternatively, one can also view DCM for evoked responses as a source reconstruction approach with temporal, physiologically informed constraints. We will illustrate this idea using, for each area, a 4-shell equivalent current dipole (ECD) model with three location and three orientation parameters. Using synthetic and real data, we show that this approach furnishes accurate and robust conditional estimates of coupling among sources and their orientations.},

@article{Salthouse1996__processing_speed_theory,
abstract = {A theory is proposed to account for some of the age-related differences reported in measures of Type A or fluid cognition. The central hypothesis in the theory is that increased age in adulthood is associated with a decrease in the speed with which many processing operations can be executed and that this reduction in speed leads to impairments in cognitive functioning because of what are termed the limited time mechanism and the simultaneity mechanism. That is, cognitive performance is degraded when processing is slow because relevant operations cannot be successfully executed (limited time) and because the products of early processing may no longer be available when later processing is complete (simultaneity). Several types of evidence, such as the discovery of considerable shared age-related variance across various measures of speed and large attenuation of the age-related influences on cognitive measures after statistical control of measures of speed, are consistent with this theory.},

abstract = {Objective: The aim of this study is to investigate the potentials (intracellular, extracellular, electrotonic) and excitability properties (strength-duration and charge-duration curves, strength-duration time constants, rheobases, recovery cycles) in three cases of uniform myelin wrap reduction (20, 50 and 70\%) along the fibre length. Methods: The internodally systematically demyelinated cases (termed as ISD1, ISD2 and ISD3) are simulated using our previous double cable model of human motor fibres. Results: In the more severely demyelinated cases, the intracellular potentials are with significantly reduced amplitude, prolonged duration and slowed conduction velocity, whereas the electrotonic potentials show greater increase in the early part of the hyperpolarizing responses. The radial decline of the extracellular potential amplitudes depends on the radial distance of the field point and increases with the increase of the distance and demyelination. The time constants and rheobasic currents increase with the increase of the degree of demyelination. In the recovery cycles, the more severely demyelinated cases have greater refractoriness (the increase in threshold current during the relative refractory period), supemormality and less late subnormality than the normal case. Conclusions: The myelin thickness has significant effects on the potentials and axonal excitability properties of the simulated demyelinated human motor fibres. The obtained abnormalities in the potentials and excitability properties can be observed in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A). Significance: The study provides new information about the pathophysiology of human demyelinating neuropathies. \&COPY; 2005 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

abstract = {Many applications of covariance structure modeling include a specification search; that is, a process of sequentially modifying a model so as to improve its fit and/or parsimony. The present study investigates whether common procedures for conducting specification searches are likely to lead to discovery of the correct population model. This is investigated by defining true population models and covariance matrices, fitting misspecified models to samples from those populations, and then carrying out searches. Various phenomena occurring in specification searches are demonstrated and discussed. Results indicate that the likelihood of success in a specification search is optimal when (a) the investigator's initial model corresponds closely to the true model, (b) the search is allowed to continue even when a statistically plausible model is obtained, (c) the investigator can place valid restrictions on permissible modifications, and (d) a large sample is used. It is shown that even under favorable conditions, models arising from specification searches must be viewed with caution, and that under unfavorable conditions, such models are routinely invalid and unstable., (C) 1986 by the American Psychological Association},

abstract = {We collected MRI diffusion tensor imaging data from 80 younger (20-32 years) and 63 older (60-71 years) healthy adults. Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) analysis revealed that white matter integrity, as indicated by decreased fractional anisotropy (FA), was disrupted in numerous structures in older compared to younger adults. These regions displayed five distinct region-specific patterns of age-related differences in other diffusivity properties: (1) increases in both radial and mean diffusivity; (2) increases in radial diffusivity; (3) no differences in parameters other than FA; (4) a decrease in axial and an increase in radial diffusivity; and (5) a decrease in axial and mean diffusivity. These patterns suggest different biological underpinnings of age-related decline in FA, such as demyelination, Wallerian degeneration, gliosis, and severe fiber loss, and may represent stages in a cascade of age-related degeneration in white matter microstructure. This first simultaneous description of age-related differences in FA, mean, axial, and radial diffusivity requires histological and functional validation as well as analyses of intermediate age groups and longitudinal samples.},

@article{Ringo1994,
abstract = {Tomasch (1954) and Aboitiz et al. (1992) found the majority of the fibers of the human corpus callosum are under 1 mu m in diameter. Electron microscopic studies of Swadlow et al. (1980) and the detailed study of LaMantia and Rakic (1990a) on macaques show the average size of the myelinated callosal axons also to be less than 1 mu m. In man, the average-sized myelinated fiber interconnecting the temporal lobes would have a one-way, interhemispheric delay of over 25 msec. Thus, finely detailed, time-critical neuronal computations (i.e., tasks that strain the capacity of the callosum and hence could not be handled by just the larger fibers) would be performed more quickly via shorter and faster intrahemispheric circuits. While one transit across the commissural system might yield tolerable delays, multiple passes as in a system involving ''settling'' would seem prohibitively slow. We suggest that these temporal limits will be avoided if the neural apparatus necessary to perform each high-resolution, time-critical task is gathered in one hemisphere. If the, presumably overlapping, neural assemblies needed to handle overlapping tasks are clustered together, this would lead to hemispheric specialization. The prediction follows that the large brains of mammals such as elephants and cetaceans will also manifest a high degree of hemispheric specialization.},

@article{Penke2012__general_factor_intelligence,
abstract = {General intelligence is a robust predictor of important life outcomes, including educational and occupational attainment, successfully managing everyday life situations, good health and longevity. Some neuronal correlates of intelligence have been discovered, mainly indicating that larger cortices in widespread parieto-frontal brain networks and efficient neuronal information processing support higher intelligence. However, there is a lack of established associations between general intelligence and any basic structural brain parameters that have a clear functional meaning. Here, we provide evidence that lower brain-wide white matter tract integrity exerts a substantial negative effect on general intelligence through reduced information-processing speed. Structural brain magnetic resonance imaging scans were acquired from 420 older adults in their early 70s. Using quantitative tractography, we measured fractional anisotropy and two white matter integrity biomarkers that are novel to the study of intelligence: longitudinal relaxation time (T1) and magnetisation transfer ratio. Substantial correlations among 12 major white matter tracts studied allowed the extraction of three general factors of biomarker-specific brain-wide white matter tract integrity. Each was independently associated with general intelligence, together explaining 10\% of the variance, and their effect was completely mediated by information-processing speed. Unlike most previously established neurostructural correlates of intelligence, these findings suggest a functionally plausible model of intelligence, where structurally intact axonal fibres across the brain provide the neuroanatomical infrastructure for fast information processing within widespread brain networks, supporting general intelligence.},

abstract = {In this article, we attempt to distinguish between the properties of moderator and mediator variables at a number of levels. First, we seek to make theorists and researchers aware of the importance of not using the terms moderator and mediator interchangeably by carefully elaborating, both conceptually and strategically, the many ways in which moderators and mediators differ. We then go beyond this largely pedagogical function and delineate the conceptual and strategic implications of making use of such distinctions with regard to a wide range of phenomena, including control and stress, attitudes, and personality traits. We also provide a specific compendium of analytic procedures appropriate for making the most effective use of the moderator and mediator distinction, both separately and in terms of a broader causal system that includes both moderators and mediators.},

This paper reviews recent findings in animals and man, showing that the visual areas of the two hemispheres control each other's dynamics. The interaction is stimulus-dependent and stimulus-specific. It consists of both excitatory and inhibitory inputs controlling the formation of synchronous neuronal assemblies across and within the hemispheres. The findings are consistent with the geometry of callosal axons and their inferred computational properties. These are the first findings to suggest a direct relationship between the geometry of cortical connections, and the formation of stimulus-driven synchronous neuronal assemblies.},

Notably in a biologically realistic architecture the latter vary under spatial translations (heterogeneous), the former do not (homogeneous). To understand the mutual effects of homogeneous and heterogeneous connectivity, we study the stability of the steady state activity of a neural field as a function of its connectivity and transmission speed. We show that myelination, a developmentally relevant change of the heterogeneous connectivity, always results in the stabilization of the steady state via oscillatory instabilities, independent of the local connectivity. Nonoscillatory instabilities are shown to be independent of any influences of time delay.},

METHOD: The areas of three subregions (anterior, body, and posterior) of the corpus callosum were examined on midsagittal magnetic resonance images of 35 autistic subjects whose mean age was 18 years and 36 healthy comparison subjects matched on age and IQ. RESULTS: After controlling for total brain volume, gender, and performance IQ, the authors detected a significantly smaller size of the body and posterior subregions of the corpus callosum in the autistic individuals. CONCLUSIONS: In the context of recent reports of increased brain size in autism, several possible mechanisms are considered in exploring the significance of a smaller relative size of the corpus callosum in autism.},

abstract = {Current neuroimaging software offer users an incredible opportunity to analyze their data in different ways, with different underlying assumptions. Several sophisticated software packages (e.g., AFNI, BrainVoyager, FSL, FreeSurfer, Nipy, R, SPM) are used to process and analyze large and often diverse (highly multi-dimensional) data. However, this heterogeneous collection of specialized applications creates several issues that hinder replicable, efficient, and optimal use of neuroimaging analysis approaches: (1) No uniform access to neuroimaging analysis software and usage information; (2) No framework for comparative algorithm development and dissemination; (3) Personnel turnover in laboratories often limits methodological continuity and training new personnel takes time; (4) Neuroimaging software packages do not address computational efficiency; and (5) Methods sections in journal articles are inadequate for reproducing results. To address these issues, we present Nipype (Neuroimaging in Python: Pipelines and Interfaces; http://nipy.org/nipype), an open-source, community-developed, software package, and scriptable library. Nipype solves the issues by providing Interfaces to existing neuroimaging software with uniform usage semantics and by facilitating interaction between these packages using Workflows. Nipype provides an environment that encourages interactive exploration of algorithms, eases the design of Workflows within and between packages, allows rapid comparative development of algorithms and reduces the learning curve necessary to use different packages. Nipype supports both local and remote execution on multi-core machines and clusters, without additional scripting. Nipype is Berkeley Software Distribution licensed, allowing anyone unrestricted usage. An open, community-driven development philosophy allows the software to quickly adapt and address the varied needs of the evolving neuroimaging community, especially in the context of increasing demand for reproducible research.},

abstract = {Cortical areas differ in the size and distribution of neuronal cell bodies, density, and distribution of myelinated axons, connections, and functional properties. We find that they also differ in the diameter of long corticofugal axons, with the thickest axons originating from primary motor, somatosensory, and visual areas and the thinnest ones from prefrontal and temporal areas. Since diameter is proportional to axonal conduction velocity, it can be inferred that action potentials issued from the different areas will be relayed to their targets at different speed. Conduction delays also depend on conduction distance. By computing conduction velocity and conduction distances, we found the longest conduction delays for the primary visual and temporal areas and the shortest for the premotor, primary motor, and somatosensory areas, compatible with the available electrophysiological data. These findings seem to establish a new principle in cortical organization relevant to the pathophysiology of neurological or psychiatric illnesses as well as to the speed of information processing in cortical circuits.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Myelination of the human brain results in roughly quadratic trajectories of myelin content and integrity, reaching a maximum in mid-life and then declining in older age. This trajectory is most evident in vulnerable later myelinating association regions such as frontal lobes and may be the biological substrate for similar trajectories of cognitive processing speed. Speed of movement, such as maximal finger tapping speed (FTS), requires high-frequency action potential (AP) bursts and is associated with myelin integrity. We tested the hypothesis that the age-related trajectory of FTS is related to brain myelin integrity. METHODS: A sensitive in vivo MRI biomarker of myelin integrity (calculated transverse relaxation rates (R(2))) of frontal lobe white matter (FLwm) was measured in a sample of very healthy males (N=72) between 23 and 80 years of age. To assess specificity, R(2) of a contrasting early-myelinating region (splenium of the corpus callosum) was also measured. RESULTS: FLwm R(2) and FTS measures were significantly correlated (r=.45, p<.0001) with no association noted in the early-myelinating region (splenium). Both FLwm R(2) and FTS had significantly quadratic lifespan trajectories that were virtually indistinguishable and both reached a peak at 39 years of age and declined with an accelerating trajectory thereafter. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that in this very healthy male sample, maximum motor speed requiring high-frequency AP burst may depend on brain myelin integrity. To the extent that the FLwm changes assessed by R(2) contribute to an age-related reduction in AP burst frequency, it is possible that other brain functions dependent on AP bursts may also be affected. Non-invasive measures of myelin integrity together with testing of basic measures of processing speed may aid in developing and targeting anti-aging treatments to mitigate age-related functional declines.},

abstract = {In the developing frog visual system, topographic refinement of the retinotectal projection depends on electrical activity. In vivo whole-cell recording from developing Xenopus tectal neurons shows that convergent retinotectal synapses undergo activity-dependent cooperation and competition following correlated pre- and postsynaptic spiking within a narrow time window. Synaptic inputs activated repetitively within 20 ms before spiking of the tectal neuron become potentiated, whereas subthreshold inputs activated within 20 ms after spiking become depressed. Thus both the initial synaptic strength and the temporal order of activation are critical for heterosynaptic interactions among convergent synaptic inputs during activity-dependent refinement of developing neural networks.},

abstract = {The cortex is a complex system, characterized by its dynamics and architecture, which underlie many functions such as action, perception, learning, language, and cognition. Its structural architecture has been studied for more than a hundred years; however, its dynamics have been addressed much less thoroughly. In this paper, we review and integrate, in a unifying framework, a variety of computational approaches that have been used to characterize the dynamics of the cortex, as evidenced at different levels of measurement. Computational models at different space-time scales help us understand the fundamental mechanisms that underpin neural processes and relate these processes to neuroscience data. Modeling at the single neuron level is necessary because this is the level at which information is exchanged between the computing elements of the brain; the neurons. Mesoscopic models tell us how neural elements interact to yield emergent behavior at the level of microcolumns and cortical columns. Macroscopic models can inform us about whole brain dynamics and interactions between large-scale neural systems such as cortical regions, the thalamus, and brain stem. Each level of description relates uniquely to neuroscience data, from single-unit recordings, through local field potentials to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalogram (EEG), and magnetoencephalogram (MEG). Models of the cortex can establish which types of large-scale neuronal networks can perform computations and characterize their emergent properties. Mean-field and related formulations of dynamics also play an essential and complementary role as forward models that can be inverted given empirical data. This makes dynamic models critical in integrating theory and experiments. We argue that elaborating principled and informed models is a prerequisite for grounding empirical neuroscience in a cogent theoretical framework, commensurate with the achievements in the physical sciences.},

abstract = {Between-person differences in white matter microstructure may partly generalize across the brain and partly play out differently for distinct tracts. We used diffusion-tensor imaging and structural equation modeling to investigate this issue in a sample of 260 adults aged 60-87 years. Mean fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity of seven white matter tracts in each hemisphere were quantified. Results showed good fit of a model positing that individual differences in white matter microstructure are structured according to tracts. A general factor, although accounting for variance in the measures, did not adequately represent the individual differences. This indicates the presence of a substantial amount of tract-specific individual differences in white matter microstructure. In addition, individual differences are to a varying degree shared between tracts, indicating that general factors also affect white matter microstructure. Age-related differences in white matter microstructure were present for all tracts. Correlations among tract factors did not generally increase as a function of age, suggesting that aging is not a process with homogenous effects on white matter microstructure across the brain. These findings highlight the need for future research to examine whether relations between white matter microstructure and diverse outcomes are specific or general.},

abstract = {Objective: The purpose of the present investigation is to study the potentials and axonal excitability properties in progressively greater degrees of uniform paranodal demyelination of human motor nerve fibres. Methods: Using our previous double cable model of human motor nerve fibre, 3 paranodally systematically demyelinated cases (termed as PSD1, PSD2 and PSD3) are simulated by an uniform paranodal. resistance reduction (20, 50 and 77\%) along the fibre length. Results: Considerably reduced amplitudes, prolonged durations and slowed conduction velocities are obtained for the intracellular potentials of the PSD2 and PSD3 cases. In contrast, the electrotonic potentials show abnormally greater increase in the early part of the hyperpolarizing responses. The extracellular potentials indicate increased polyphasia in the PSD3 case. The strength-duration time constants are shorter and the rheobases higher in the demyelinated cases. In the recovery cycles, the demyelinated cases have less refractoriness, greater supernormality and less late subnormality than the normal case. Conclusions: The reduction of the paranodal seal resistance has significant effects on the potentials and axonal excitability properties of the simulated demyelinated human motor fibres. The obtained abnormalities in the potentials and excitability properties can be observed in vivo in patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. Significance: The study provides important information about the pathology of human demyelinating neuropathies. \&COPY; 2005 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

abstract = {Working memory (WM) is the part of the brain's memory system that provides temporary storage and manipulation of information necessary for cognition. Although WM has limited capacity at any given time, it has vast memory content in the sense that it acts on the brain's nearly infinite repertoire of lifetime long-term memories. Using simulations, we show that large memory content and WM functionality emerge spontaneously if we take the spike-timing nature of neuronal processing into account. Here, memories are represented by extensively overlapping groups of neurons that exhibit stereotypical time-locked spatiotemporal spike-timing patterns, called polychronous patterns; and synapses forming such polychronous neuronal groups (PNGs) are subject to associative synaptic plasticity in the form of both long-term and short-term spike-timing dependent plasticity. While long-term potentiation is essential in PNG formation, we show how short-term plasticity can temporarily strengthen the synapses of selected PNGs and lead to an increase in the spontaneous reactivation rate of these PNGs. This increased reactivation rate, consistent with in vivo recordings during WM tasks, results in high interspike interval variability and irregular, yet systematically changing, elevated firing rate profiles within the neurons of the selected PNGs. Additionally, our theory explains the relationship between such slowly changing firing rates and precisely timed spikes, and it reveals a novel relationship between WM and the perception of time on the order of seconds.},

abstract = {Inferences about brain function, using neuroimaging data, rest on models of how the data were caused. These models can be quite diverse, ranging from conceptual models of functional anatomy to nonlinear mathematical models of hemodynamics. However, they all have to be internally consistent because they model the same thing. This consistency encompasses many levels of description and places constraints on the statistical models, adopted for data analysis, and the experimental designs they embody. The aim of this review is to introduce the key models used in imaging neuroscience and how they relate to each other. We start with anatomical models of functional brain architectures, which motivate some of the fundaments of neuroimaging. We then turn to basic statistical models (e.g., the general linear model) used for making classical and Bayesian inferences about where neuronal responses are expressed. By incorporating biophysical constraints, these basic models can be finessed and, in a dynamic setting, rendered causal. This allows us to infer how interactions among brain regions are mediated.},

abstract = {The effect of aging on myelin sheaths in the rhesus monkey was studied in the vertical bundles of nerve fibers that traverse monkey cerebral cortex in primary visual area 17 and prefrontal area 46. As shown previously, with age the internodes of many of these myelin sheaths show structural changes, the most common of which is an accumulation of electron-dense cytoplasm within some sheaths, a change which is considered to indicate that breakdown of myelin is taking place. Supporting the suggestion that myelin is breaking down with age, astrocytes in the cortices of old monkeys contain phagocytosed myelin and some of the inclusion bodies in astrocytes label with antibodies to myelin basic protein. There is also evidence that remyelination is taking place. Thus, we have found an increase in the frequency of profiles of paranodes when transverse sections of the nerve fibers are examined. The increase in paranodal frequency with age is 57\% in area 17 and 90\% in area 46. This increase cannot all be attributed to lengthening of paranodes with age, because in area 17 the 11\% increase in mean paranodal length with age is insufficient to account for an age-related increase in paranodal profile frequency. Consequently, there must be an increase in the number of internodal lengths of myelin with age, as would occur if shorter lengths of myelin are produced by remyelination. In support of the proposal that remyelination is occurring, short internodal lengths of myelin have been found in the nerve bundles passing through the cortices of old monkeys and inappropriately thin sheaths occur around some axons. Both of these features are generally considered to be the hallmarks of remyelination. Consequently, it is proposed that in the aging cerebral cortex of the monkey there is some breakdown of internodes of myelin with subsequent remyelination that leads to the formation of some new and shorter internodal lengths of myelin.},

abstract = {The corpus callosum (CC) provides the main route of communication between the 2 hemispheres of the brain. In monkeys, chimpanzees, and humans, callosal axons of distinct size interconnect functionally different cortical areas. Thinner axons in the genu and in the posterior body of the CC interconnect the prefrontal and parietal areas, respectively, and thicker axons in the midbody and in the splenium interconnect primary motor, somatosensory, and visual areas. At all locations, axon diameter, and hence its conduction velocity, increases slightly in the chimpanzee compared with the macaque because of an increased number of large axons but not between the chimpanzee and man. This, together with the longer connections in larger brains, doubles the expected conduction delays between the hemispheres, from macaque to man, and amplifies their range about 3-fold. These changes can have several consequences for cortical dynamics, particularly on the cycle of interhemispheric oscillators.},

@article{Birren1995a,
abstract = {Over 100 years of observations have established that slowness of behavior is a characteristic of becoming old, although it is now recognized that health, use of medications, and physical activity may modify the extent of the slowing. Early research indicated that there is a limited contribution to slowing by peripheral sensory-motor factors. Substantial evidence has pointed to the central nervous system as the locus of the slowing. Recent investigators have expressed divided opinions about whether there is a pervasive general slowing of behavior by the central nervous system or whether there are specific localized mechanisms. This is not unlike early disputed views of the brain as having localized or global behavioral functions: Both principles appear to be simultaneously true. Sufficient research has been conducted to indicate that there are specific factors as well as a general process associated with the slowing of behavior with advancing age. Whether such slowing is a primary or secondary cause of age differences in cognitive processes is a significant scientific issue. A marked broadening of research on aging has been accompanied by an interest in identifying both the neurophysiological correlates of slowing as well as its role in specific cognitive processes. Yet another aspect of the changing research picture is the trend to move beyond the mere use of chronological age as the sole basis for comparing performance differences. Measurement of more independent variables is suggested as part of clusters or causal complexes that will indicate sources of the changes in speed and other aspects of behavior. These causal complexes include biological indicators such as disease, physiological capacity for work, and length of life, as well as causal complexes of social factors involving such variables as education, occupation, and ethnicity. There has been considerable discussion of markers of aging. In this approach, factors found to be closely associated with advancing age are used as measures of the effectiveness of attempts to modify the course of aging, e.g. by diet, exercise, new learning, and drugs. Along with other biomarkers of aging, speed of behavior may prove to be a criterion for assessing the impact of interventions on the rate and processes of aging. As a marker of aging, speed needs further exploration that will compare the slowness observed in different subgroups of adults with a wide range of outcomes in their productivity, capacity for adaptation to life's demands, and health. The present status of information about slowness of behavior with advancing age indicates that it is one of the most reliable features of human life.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {Human white matter integrity has been related to information processing speed, but it is unknown whether impaired integrity results from localized processes or is a general property shared across white matter tracts. Based on diffusion MRI scans of 132 healthy individuals with a narrow age range around 72 years, the integrity of eight major white matter tracts was quantified using probabilistic neighborhood tractography. Principal component analyses (PCAs) were conducted on the correlations between the eight tracts, separately for four tract-averaged integrity parameters: fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, and radial and axial diffusivity. For all four parameters, the PCAs revealed a single general factor explaining approximately 45\% of the individual differences across all eight tracts. Individuals' scores on a general factor that captures the common variance in white matter integrity had significant associations with a general factor of information processing speed for fractional anisotropy (r = -0.24, p = 0.007) and radial diffusivity (r = 0.21, p = 0.016), but not with general intelligence or memory factors. Individual tracts showed no associations beyond what the common integrity factor explained. Just as different types of cognitive ability tests share much of their variance, these novel findings show that a substantial amount of variance in white matter integrity is shared between different tracts. Therefore, impaired cortical connection is substantially a global process affecting various major tracts simultaneously. Further studies should investigate whether these findings relate more to the role of tract integrity and information processing speed in nonpathological cognitive aging or in lifelong-stable processes.},

Increasingly, these methods are also being integrated in the form of the analysis of ―mediated moderation‖ or ―moderated mediation,‖ or what Hayes (2013; Hayes \& Preacher, 2012a) calls conditional process modeling. After a broad overview of some of the basic concepts of mediation analysis, moderation analysis, and conditional process modeling, I introduce PROCESS, a versatile modeling tool freely-available for SPSS and SAS that integrates many of the functions of existing and popular statistical tools for mediation and moderation analysis published in this journal and elsewhere into one easy-to-use procedure. PROCESS uses an ordinary least squares or logistic regression-based path analytical framework for estimating direct and indirect effects in simple and multiple mediator models, two and three way interactions in moderation models along with simple slopes and regions of significance for probing interactions, conditional indirect effects in moderated mediation models with a single or multiple mediators and moderators, and indirect effects of interactions in mediated moderation models also with a single or multiple mediators. Bootstrap methods are implemented for inference about indirect effects in both unmoderated as well as moderated mediation and mediated moderation models. Examples of the use of PROCESS are provided, and some of its additional features as well as some limitations are described.},

abstract = {Activity-driven modifications in synaptic connections between neurons in the neocortex may occur during development and learning. In dual whole-cell voltage recordings from pyramidal neurons, the coincidence of postsynaptic action potentials (APs) and unitary excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) was found to induce changes in EPSPs. Their average amplitudes were differentially up- or down-regulated, depending on the precise timing of postsynaptic APs relative to EPSPs. These observations suggest that APs propagating back into dendrites serve to modify single active synaptic connections, depending on the pattern of electrical activity in the pre- and postsynaptic neurons.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study is to investigate whether specific patterns of correlation exist in diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) parameters across different white matter tracts in the normal human brain, and whether the relative strengths of these putative microstructural correlations might reflect phylogenetic and functional similarities between tracts. We performed quantitative DTI fiber tracking on 44 healthy adult volunteers to obtain tract-based measures of mean diffusivity (MD), fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD) from four homologous pairs of neocortical association pathways (arcuate fasciculi, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculi, inferior longitudinal fasciculi, and uncinate fasciculi bilaterally), a homologous pair of limbic association pathways (left and right dorsal cingulum bundles), and a homologous pair of cortical-subcortical projection pathways (left and right corticospinal tracts). From the resulting intertract correlation matrices, we show that there are statistically significant correlations of DTI parameters between tracts, and that there are statistically significant variations among these inter-tract correlations. Furthermore, we observe that many, but by no means all, of the strongest correlations are between homologous tracts in the left and right hemispheres. Even among homologous pairs of tracts, there are wide variations in the degree of coupling. Finally, we generate a data-driven hierarchical clustering of the fiber pathways based on pairwise FA correlations to demonstrate that the neocortical association pathways tend to group separately from the limbic pathways at trend-level statistical significance, and that the projection pathways of the left and right corticospinal tracts comprise the most distant outgroup with high confidence (p<0.01). Hence, specific patterns of microstructural correlation exist between tracts and may reflect phylogenetic and functional similarities between tracts. The study of these microstructural relationships between white matter pathways might aid research on the genetic basis and on the behavioral effects of axonal connectivity, as well as provide a revealing new perspective with which to investigate neurological and psychiatric disorders.

@article{Bojak2010__axonal_velocity_distributions,
abstract = {By modelling the average activity of large neuronal populations, continuum mean field models (MFMs) have become an increasingly important theoretical tool for understanding the emergent activity of cortical tissue. In order to be computationally tractable, long-range propagation of activity in MFMs is often approximated with partial differential equations (PDEs). However, PDE approximations in current use correspond to underlying axonal velocity distributions incompatible with experimental measurements. In order to rectify this deficiency, we here introduce novel propagation PDEs that give rise to smooth unimodal distributions of axonal conduction velocities. We also argue that velocities estimated from fibre diameters in slice and from latency measurements, respectively, relate quite differently to such distributions, a significant point for any phenomenological description. Our PDEs are then successfully fit to fibre diameter data from human corpus callosum and rat subcortical white matter. This allows for the first time to simulate long-range conduction in the mammalian brain with realistic, convenient PDEs. Furthermore, the obtained results suggest that the propagation of activity in rat and human differs significantly beyond mere scaling. The dynamical consequences of our new formulation are investigated in the context of a well known neural field model. On the basis of Turing instability analyses, we conclude that pattern formation is more easily initiated using our more realistic propagator. By increasing characteristic conduction velocities, a smooth transition can occur from self-sustaining bulk oscillations to travelling waves of various wavelengths, which may influence axonal growth during development. Our analytic results are also corroborated numerically using simulations on a large spatial grid. Thus we provide here a comprehensive analysis of empirically constrained activity propagation in the context of MFMs, which will allow more realistic studies of mammalian brain activity in the future.},

Mediation exists when a predictor affects a dependent variable indirectly through at least one intervening variable, or mediator. Methods to assess mediation involving multiple simultaneous mediators have received little attention in the methodological literature despite a clear need. We provide an overview of simple and multiple mediation and explore three approaches that can be used to investigate indirect processes, as well as methods for contrasting two or more mediators within a single model. We present an illustrative example, assessing and contrasting potential mediators of the relationship between the helpfulness of socialization agents and job satisfaction.

abstract = {Claudin family proteins form the physical barriers of tight junctions (TJs) and regulate paracellular diffusion across polarized epithelia. In addition to these heterotypic TJs, claudin 11 forms autotypic TJs comprising the radial component of central nervous system myelin. The exact function of these TJs has been unclear, although their location at the membrane perimeter is well sited to regulate diffusion between the interstitium and intramyelinic space. In this study, we demonstrate that claudin 11 affords rapid nerve conduction principally for small diameter myelinated axons. Claudin 11-null mice have preserved myelin and axonal architecture, but as much as a 60\% decrease in conduction. They also have increased action potential thresholds and activated internodal potassium channels. These data indicate that TJs modulate the biophysical properties of myelin. Computational modeling reveals that claudin 11 reduces current flow through myelin and moderates its capacitive charging. Together, our data shed new light on myelin structural components and our understanding of the biology and pathophysiology of this membrane.},

abstract = {Multilevel crosstalk as a neural basis for motor control has been widely discussed in the literature. Since no natural process is instantaneous, any crosstalk model should incorporate time delays, which are known to induce temporal coupling between functional elements and stabilize or destabilize a particular mode of coordination. In this article, we systematically study the dynamics of rhythmic bimanual coordination under the influence of varying connection topology as realized by callosal fibers, cortico-thalamic projections, and crossing peripheral fibers. Such connectivity contributes to various degrees of neural crosstalk between the effectors which we continuously parameterize in a mathematical model. We identify the stability regimes of bimanual coordination as a function of the degree of neural crosstalk, movement amplitude and the time delays involved due to signal processing. Prominent examples include explanations of the decreased stability of the antiphase mode of coordination in split brain patients and the role of coupling in mediating bimanual coordination.},

It has been suggested that both brain nerve conduction velocity and PNCV are positively correlated with intelligence (Reed, 1984) and that heritable differences in NCV may explain part of the well established heritability of intelligence. The Standard Progressive Matrices test was administered to 210 twin pairs to obtain IQ scores. Median nerve PNCV was determined in a subgroup of 156 pairs. Genetic analyses showed a heritability of 0.65 for Raven IQ score and 0.77 for PNCV. However, there was no significant phenotypic correlation between IQ score and PNCV.},

abstract = {The largest bundle of axonal fibers in the entire mammalian brain, namely the corpus callosum, is the pathway through which almost half a billion neurons scattered over all neocortical areas can exert an influence on their contralateral targets. These fibers are thus crucial participants in the numerous cortical functions requiring collaborative processing of information across the hemispheres. One of such operations is to combine the two partial cortical maps of the visual field into a single, coherent representation. This paper reviews recent anatomical, computational and electrophysiological studies on callosal connectivity in the cat visual system. We analyzed the morphology of individual callosal axons linking primary visual cortices using three-dimensional light-microscopic techniques. While only a minority of callosal axons seem to perform a strict [`]point-to-point' mapping between retinotopically corresponding sites in both hemispheres, many others have widespread arbors and terminate into a handful of distant, radially oriented tufts. Therefore, the firing of a single callosal neuron might influence several cortical columns within the opposite hemisphere. Computer simulation was then applied to investigate how the intricate geometry of these axons might shape the spatio-temporal distribution of trans-callosal inputs. Based on the linear relation between diameter and conduction velocity of myelinated fibers, the theoretical delays required for a single action potential to reach all presynaptic boutons of a given arbor were derived from the caliber, g-ratio and length of successive axonal segments. This analysis suggests that the architecture of callosal axons is, in principle, suitable to promote the synchronous activation of multiple targets located across distant columns in the opposite hemisphere. Finally, electrophysiological recordings performed in several laboratories have shown the existence of stimulus-dependent synchronization of visual responses across the two hemispheres. Possible implications of these findings are discussed in the context of temporal tagging of neuronal assemblies.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To establish a general methodology for quantifying streamline-based diffusion fiber tracking methods in terms of probability of connection between points and/or regions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The commonly used streamline approach is adapted to exploit the uncertainty in the orientation of the principal direction of diffusion defined for each image voxel. Running the streamline process repeatedly using Monte Carlo methods to exploit this inherent uncertainty generates maps of connection probability. Uncertainty is defined by interpreting the shape of the diffusion orientation profile provided by the diffusion tensor in terms of the underlying microstructure. RESULTS: Two candidates for describing the uncertainty in the diffusion tensor are proposed and maps of probability of connection to chosen start points or regions are generated in a number of major tracts. CONCLUSION: The methods presented provide a generic framework for utilizing streamline methods to generate probabilistic maps of connectivity.},

abstract = {This study assesses the effects of age on the composition of the anterior commissure of the rhesus monkey. The anterior commissures of nine young (5-10 years), five middle-aged (15-20 years), and eight old (25-35 years) monkeys were examined by light and electron microscopy. In all, 90-95\% of the nerve fibers in the anterior commissure are myelinated. With age, the structure of the myelin sheaths of some nerve fibers is altered. Some of the axons also show signs of degeneration and this leads to a loss of nerve fibers. Thus, in young and the middle-aged monkeys the mean number of myelinated nerve fibers in the anterior commissure is 2.2 x 10(6), while in the old monkeys the mean is 1.2 x 10(6). Increasing age is correlated with a reduction in the number of myelinated nerve fibers in the anterior commissure, an increase in the frequency of structural alterations in myelin sheaths, and an increase in the frequency of occurrence of degenerating axons. However, the number of myelinated nerve fibers is the only variable that correlates with cognition: in monkeys 5-20 years of age the fewer the number of nerve fibers the poorer the cognitive performance, as measured by our Cognitive Impairment Index (CII). The most common neuroglial cells in the anterior commissure are oligodendrocytes. They account for 86\% of all neuroglial cell profiles, while astrocytes account for 9\%, and microglial cells for 5\% of profiles. There is no apparent change with age in the total numbers of neuroglial cells, although as they age each of the neuroglial cell types acquires some inclusions in their cytoplasm. The data, together with those from previous studies, support the concept that in aging there is a ubiquitous loss of myelinated nerve fibers from the brain and that fiber loss is preceded by alterations in the structure of many of the myelin sheaths.

abstract = {How objects are represented and processed in the brain is a central topic in cognitive neuroscience. Previous studies have shown that knowledge of objects is represented in a feature-based distributed neural system primarily involving occipital and temporal cortical regions. Research with nonhuman primates suggest that these features are structured in a hierarchical system with posterior neurons in the inferior temporal cortex representing simple features and anterior neurons in the perirhinal cortex representing complex conjunctions of features (Bussey \& Saksida, 2002; Murray \& Bussey, 1999). On this account, the perirhinal cortex plays a crucial role in object identification by integrating information from different sensory systems into more complex polymodal feature conjunctions. We tested the implications of these claims for human object processing in an event-related fMRI study in which we presented colored pictures of common objects for 19 subjects to name at two levels of specificity - basic and domain. We reasoned that domain-level naming requires access to a coarser-grained representation of objects, thus involving only posterior regions of the inferior temporal cortex. In contrast, basic-level naming requires finer-grained discrimination to differentiate between similar objects, and thus should involve anterior temporal regions, including the perirhinal cortex. We found that object processing always activated the fusiform gyrus bilaterally, irrespective of the task, whereas the perirhinal cortex was only activated when the task required finer-grained discriminations. These results suggest that the same kind of hierarchical structure, which has been proposed for object processing in the monkey temporal cortex, functions in the human.},

@article{Peters2002,
abstract = {It was believed that the cause of the cognitive decline exhibited by human and non-human primates during normal aging was a loss of cortical neurons. It is now known that significant numbers of cortical neurons are not lost and other bases for the cognitive decline have been sought. One contributing factor may be changes in nerve fibers. With age some myelin sheaths exhibit degenerative changes, such as the formation of splits containing electron dense cytoplasm, and the formation on myelin balloons. It is suggested that such degenerative changes lead to cognitive decline because they cause changes in conduction velocity, resulting in a disruption of the normal timing in neuronal circuits. Yet as degeneration occurs, other changes, such as the formation of redundant myelin and increasing thickness suggest of sheaths, suggest some myelin formation is continuing during aging. Another indication of this is that oligodendrocytes increase in number with age. In addition to the myelin changes, stereological studies have shown a loss of nerve fibers from the white matter of the cerebral hemispheres of humans, while other studies have shown a loss of nerve fibers from the optic nerves and anterior commissure in monkeys. It is likely that such nerve fiber loss also contributes to cognitive decline, because of the consequent decrease in connections between neurons. Degeneration of myelin itself does not seem to result in microglial cells undertaking phagocytosis. These cells are probably only activated when large numbers of nerve fibers are lost, as can occur in the optic nerve.},

@article{Tyler2010,
abstract = {The extent to which the human brain shows evidence of functional plasticity across the lifespan has been addressed in the context of pathological brain changes and, more recently, of the changes that take place during healthy ageing. Here we examine the potential for plasticity by asking whether a strongly left-lateralized system can successfully reorganize to the right-hemisphere following left-hemisphere brain damage. To do this, we focus on syntax, a key linguistic function considered to be strongly left-lateralized, combining measures of tissue integrity, neural activation and behavioural performance. In a functional neuroimaging study participants heard spoken sentences that differentially loaded on syntactic and semantic information. While healthy controls activated a left-hemisphere network of correlated activity including Brodmann areas 45/47 and posterior middle temporal gyrus during syntactic processing, patients activated Brodmann areas 45/47 bilaterally and right middle temporal gyrus. However, voxel-based morphometry analyses showed that only tissue integrity in left Brodmann areas 45/47 was correlated with activity and performance; poor tissue integrity in left Brodmann area 45 was associated with reduced functional activity and increased syntactic deficits. Activity in the right-hemisphere was not correlated with damage in the left-hemisphere or with performance. Reduced neural integrity in the left-hemisphere through brain damage or healthy ageing results in increased right-hemisphere activation in homologous regions to those left-hemisphere regions typically involved in the young. However, these regions do not support the same linguistic functions as those in the left-hemisphere and only indirectly contribute to preserved syntactic capacity. This establishes the unique role of the left hemisphere in syntax, a core component in human language.},

abstract = {Cerebral white matter hyperintensities (WMH) reflect accumulating white matter damage with aging and impair cognition. The role of childhood intelligence is rarely considered in associations between cognitive impairment and WMH. We studied community-dwelling older people all born in 1936, in whom IQ had been assessed at age 11 years. We assessed medical histories, current cognitive ability and quantified WMH on MR imaging. Among 634 participants, mean age 72.7 (SD 0.7), age 11 IQ was the strongest predictor of late life cognitive ability. After accounting for age 11 IQ, greater WMH load was significantly associated with lower late life general cognitive ability ($\beta$ = -0.14, p < 0.01) and processing speed ($\beta$ = -0.19, p < 0.001). WMH were also associated independently with lower age 11 IQ ($\beta$ = -0.08, p < 0.05) and hypertension. In conclusion, having more WMH is significantly associated with lower cognitive ability, after accounting for prior ability, age 11IQ. Early-life IQ also influenced WMH in later life. Determining how lower IQ in youth leads to increasing brain damage with aging is important for future successful cognitive aging.},

abstract = {Compared with those in young monkeys (5-12 years of age), oligodendrocytes in area 46 of frontal cortex and primary visual cortex of monkeys over 25 years of age develop bulbous swellings along their processes. Such swellings are filled with characteristic inclusions that resemble age pigment, and other accumulations of these inclusions occur within the cell bodies of the oligodendrocytes in old monkeys. In addition, whereas the oligodendrocytes in young monkeys most commonly occur singly, in old monkeys it is common to find oligodendrocytes in groups or rows. These aggregates are often situated close to capillaries, and in some instances it is found that the cell bodies of the oligodendrocytes abut the basal lamina surrounding the capillary, so that the normally intervening astrocytic glial limiting membrane is absent. In these groups and rows, the perikarya of the oligodendrocytes are squashed close together, and it is common to find tight junctions formed between them. The cortices of the old monkeys also show extensive degeneration of myelin, and it is supposed that this is linked to the changes in the oligodendrocytes. It is hypothesized that the alterations in the oligodendrocyte-myelin system lead to changes in the rates of conduction along fibers whose myelin sheaths are affected, and this may be one of the causes of the behavioral changes associated with aging in primates.

@article{Taulu2004a,
abstract = {Stationary SQUID sensors record time-varying magnetic fields only. Any DC sources, such as magnetic impurities on the scalp or physiological DC currents, are invisible in conventional MEG with stationary sources and sensors. However, movement of the subject relative to the measurement device transforms the DC fields into time-varying MEG signals, which are either signals of interest from biomagnetic sources, or movement artifacts when caused by magnetic residue on the head. These signals can be demodulated to DC by tracking the head movement and by using this recorded information to decompose the signals into a device-independent source model. To do this we have used the signal space separation method (SSS) along with a continuous head position monitoring system. From time variations of the recorded signal, a linear equation is obtained relating the averaged MEG signal variation, the DC-source in the head, and the varying external interference. In this way an unbiased estimate is obtained for the DC source as it is automatically separated from external interference. The method was tested by feeding DC current in an artificial current dipole on a phantom head and by continuously moving and rotating this phantom randomly with a motion amplitude of several centimeters. After the SSS based movement demodulation and reconstruction of the signal from inside of the helmet, the location of the DC current dipole in the phantom could be determined with an accuracy of 2 mm. It is concluded that the method enables localization of DC sources with MEG using voluntary head movements.},

abstract = {Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been used widely to show structural brain changes during both development and aging. Lifespan studies are valuable because they connect these two processes, yet few DTI studies have been conducted that include both children and elderly subjects. This study used DTI tractography to investigate 12 major white matter connections in 403 healthy subjects aged 5-83 years. Poisson fits were used to model changes of fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) across the age span, and were highly significant for all tracts. FA increased during childhood and adolescence, reached a peak between 20 and 42 years of age, and then decreased. MD showed an opposite trend, decreasing first, reaching a minimum at 18-41 years, and then increasing later in life. These trajectories demonstrate rates and timing of development and degradation that vary regionally in the brain. The corpus callosum and fornix showed early reversals of development trends, while frontal-temporal connections (cingulum, uncinate, superior longitudinal) showed more prolonged maturation and delayed declines. FA changes were driven by perpendicular diffusivity, suggesting changes of myelination and/or axonal density. Tract volume changed significantly with age for most tracts, but did not greatly influence the FA and MD trajectories. This study demonstrates clear age-related microstructural changes throughout the brain white matter, and provides normative data that will be useful for studying white matter development in a variety of diseases and abnormal conditions.},

abstract = {Sensory association and parahippocampal cortex in the ventral temporal lobe plays an important role in sensory object recognition and control of top-down attention. Although layer V neurons located in high-order cortical structures project to multiple cortical and subcortical regions, the architecture and functional organization of this large axonal network are poorly understood. Using a large in vitro slice preparation, we examined the functional organization and spike timing properties of the descending layer V axonal network. We found that most, if not all, layer V neurons in this region can form multiple axonal pathways that project to many brain structures, both proximal and remote. The conduction velocities of different axonal pathways are highly diverse and can vary up to more than threefold. Nevertheless for those axonal projections on the ipsilateral side, the speeds of axonal conduction appear to be tuned to their length. As such, spike delivery becomes nearly isochronic along these pathways regardless of projection distance. In contrast, axons projecting to the contralateral hemisphere are significantly slower and do not participate in this lateralized isochronicity. These structural and functional features of layer V network from the ventral temporal lobe may play an important role in top-down control of sensory cue processing and attention.},

abstract = {Here, we present the first in vivo non-invasive measurement of the axon diameter distribution in the rat corpus callosum. Previously, this measurement was only possible using invasive histological methods. The axon diameter, along with other physical properties, such as the intra-axonal resistance, membrane resistance and capacitance etc. helps determine many important functional properties of nerves, such as their conduction velocity. In this work, we provide a novel magnetic resonance imaging method called AxCaliber, which can resolve the distinct signatures of trapped water molecules diffusing within axons as well as water molecules diffusing freely within the extra-axonal space. Using a series of diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging brain scans, we can reliably infer both the distribution of axon diameters and the volume fraction of these axons within each white matter voxel. We were able to verify the known microstructural variation along the corpus callosum of the rat from the anterior (genu) to posterior (splenium) regions. AxCaliber yields a narrow distribution centered 1 m in the genu and splenium and much broader distributions centered 3 m in the body of the corpus callosum. The axon diameter distribution found by AxCaliber is generally broader than those usually obtained by histology. One factor contributing to this difference is the significant tissue shrinkage that results from histological preparation. To that end, AxCaliber might provide a better estimate of the in vivo morphology of white matter. Being a magnetic resonance imaging based methodology, AxCaliber has the potential to be used in human scanners for morphological studies of white matter in normal and abnormal development, and white matter related diseases.},

abstract = {Aging is accompanied by deficits in cognitive function, which may be related to the vulnerability of myelinated nerve fibers to the normal process of aging. Loss of nerve fibers, together with age-related alterations in myelin sheath structure, may result in the inefficient and poorly coordinated conduction of neuronal signals. Until now, the ultrastructural analysis of cerebral white matter fiber tracts associated with frontal lobe areas critical in cognitive processing has been limited. In this study we analyzed the morphology and area number density of myelinated nerve fibers in the cingulate bundle and genu of the corpus callosum in behaviorally assessed young, middle aged, and old rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta). In both structures, normal aging results in a 20\% decrease in the number of myelinated nerve fibers per unit area, while remaining nerve fibers exhibit an increasing frequency of degenerative changes in their myelin sheaths throughout middle and old age. Concomitantly, myelination continues in older monkeys, suggesting ongoing, albeit inadequate, reparative processes. Despite similar patterns of degeneration in both fiber tracts, only the age-related changes in the cingulate bundle correlate with declining cognitive function, underscoring its role as a critical corticocortical pathway linking the medial prefrontal, cingulate, and parahippocampal cortices in processes of working memory, recognition memory, and other higher cognitive faculties. These results further demonstrate the important role myelinated nerve fiber degeneration plays in the pathogenesis of age-related cognitive decline.},

abstract = {During normal aging there is a reduction in white matter volume in the cerebral hemispheres and structural abnormalities in myelin in some parts of the central nervous system, but whether nerve fibers are lost with age and whether the myelin changes are ubiquitous is not known. Studying the optic nerve, which is a circumscribed bundle of nerve fibers, offers an opportunity to gain further insight into the effects of normal aging on white matter. The present study examined the optic nerves from young (4-10 years) and old (27-33 years) rhesus monkeys using light and electron microscopy. These nerves had been perfused transcardially to obtain optimal preservation of the tissue. Varying degrees of degeneration were encountered in all the optic nerves from the old monkeys. The changes included myelin abnormalities, similar to those reported in other parts of the central nervous system; the presence of degenerating axons and their sheaths; changes in neuroglial cells; and thickening of the trabeculae of connective tissue in the nerve. The total number of nerve fibers was reduced from an average of 1.6 x 10(6) in the young optic nerves to as few as 4 x 10(5) in one old monkey, and with one exception in all of the old optic nerves the packing density of nerve fibers was less than in any of the young optic nerves. The degenerative changes were most marked in those optic nerves that contained the fewest nerve fibers. J. Comp. Neurol. 429: 541-553, 2001. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {The effect of age on layer 1 of area 46 of prefrontal cortex was determined in the cerebral cortices of 15 rhesus monkeys, 13 of which had been behaviorally tested. Five of the monkeys were young (5-7 years of age), three were middle-aged (9-12 years) and seven were old (24-32 years). It was found that with age, layer 1 becomes significantly thinner and the glial limiting membrane becomes thicker. Counts of synapses in layer 1 of seven of these monkeys using the physical disector method on thin sections revealed that compared to young monkeys, there is a 30-60\% reduction in the density of synapses per unit volume in old monkeys. This loss of synapses is accompanied by a reduction in the frequency of profiles of postsynaptic dendrites and their spines from the neuropil of layer 1, indicating that some spiny dendrites that belong to the apical dendritic tufts of pyramidal cells are degenerating and being lost with age. Correlation of these morphological changes with the behavioral data shows that there is a significant correlation between the thickness of layer 1 and memory function, as measured by the 2 min delay condition of the delayed non-matching to sample task. Also, there is significant correlation between the numerical density of synapses in layer 1 and three of the behavioral measures used, as well as the Cognitive Impairment Index. Thus, the changes that occur with age in layer 1 provide one possible basis for the age-related cognitive impairment evidenced in monkeys and humans alike.},

@article{Deco2009__key_role_of_coupling_delay_noise,
abstract = {A growing body of neuroimaging research has documented that, in the absence of an explicit task, the brain shows temporally coherent activity. This so-called "resting state'' activity or, more explicitly, the default-mode network, has been associated with daydreaming, free association, stream of consciousness, or inner rehearsal in humans, but similar patterns have also been found under anesthesia and in monkeys. Spatiotemporal activity patterns in the default-mode network are both complex and consistent, which raises the question whether they are the expression of an interesting cognitive architecture or the consequence of intrinsic network constraints. In numerical simulation, we studied the dynamics of a simplified cortical network using 38 noise-driven (Wilson-Cowan) oscillators, which in isolation remain just below their oscillatory threshold. Time delay coupling based on lengths and strengths of primate corticocortical pathways leads to the emergence of 2 sets of 40-Hz oscillators. The sets showed synchronization that was anticorrelated at <0.1 Hz across the sets in line with a wide range of recent experimental observations. Systematic variation of conduction velocity, coupling strength, and noise level indicate a high sensitivity of emerging synchrony as well as simulated blood flow blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) on the underlying parameter values. Optimal sensitivity was observed around conduction velocities of 1-2 m/s, with very weak coupling between oscillators. An additional finding was that the optimal noise level had a characteristic scale, indicating the presence of stochastic resonance, which allows the network dynamics to respond with high sensitivity to changes in diffuse feedback activity.},

@article{Marner2003__marked_loss_of_myelinated_fibres,
abstract = {The white matter is the structure of the brain that declines most with age-almost 30\%, but little is known about the age-effect on the fibers that constitute the white matter. In the present study, the total length of myelinated fibers was measured with a newly developed stereologic method. Specimens came from 36 normal Danes (18 males and 18 females) with an age ranging between 18 and 93 years. Samples were taken systematically and randomly from the white matter, and the biopsy specimens were randomly rotated before sectioning to avoid bias due to the anisotropic nature of nerve fibers. The fibers were counted at light microscopic level at approximately 10,000x magnification, and the diameter of each counted fiber was measured to get the diameter distribution. Males were found to have a total myelinated fiber length of 176,000 km at the age of 20 and 97,200 km at the age of 80, whereas the total length in females was 149,000 km at the age of 20 and 82,000 km at the age of 80. This finding corresponds to a 10\% decrease per decade or a total decrease of 45\% from the age of 20 to 80 years, and a sex difference of 16\%. The fiber diameter distribution showed that primarily the thinner fibers were lost with a relative preservation of the thicker ones. The marked loss of myelinated nerve fibers with age could explain some of the cognitive decline seen in the elderly.},

abstract = {Discusses problems in intelligence research. First, it is hard to get far in discussing cognitive ability differences. There are too few representative samples in research on cognitive ability differences. Researchers can invest too much in the names given to constructs. The research area has been slow to realise that overall reaction times and their variabilities correlate better with psychometric intelligence than do cognitive components extracted from reaction time procedures. For many psychologists, a test measures a construct because they say it does. People might guffaw, but brain size really does correlate significantly with psychometric intelligence. Part of cognitive ageing is the slowing of the brain's 'processing speed', but what this processing speed comprises is not known. There is too little appreciation that so-called genetic studies can do far more than provide heritability estimates. Four behavioural tendencies were identified among some intelligence researchers that might limit progress. To criticise researchers' behaviours within one's research area and also to accuse observers of failing to appreciate the area's achievements attracts dudgeon from both sides.},

abstract = {There are many reports of relations between age and cognitive variables and of relations between age and variables representing different aspects of brain structure and a few reports of relations between brain structure variables and cognitive variables. These findings have sometimes led to inferences that the age-related brain changes cause the age-related cognitive changes. Although this conclusion may well be true, it is widely recognized that simple correlations are not sufficient to warrant causal conclusions, and other types of correlational information, such as mediation and correlations between longitudinal brain changes and longitudinal cognitive changes, also have limitations with respect to causal inferences. These issues are discussed, and the existing results on relations of regional volume, white matter hyperintensities, and diffusion tensor imaging measures of white matter integrity to age and to measures of cognitive functioning are reviewed. It is concluded that at the current time the evidence that these aspects of brain structure are neuroanatomical substrates of age-related cognitive decline is weak. The final section contains several suggestions concerning measurement and methodology that may lead to stronger conclusions in the future.},

abstract = {To assess developmental and aging changes in human sensory systems, components of short-latency somatosensory, brain-stem auditory and pattern-reversal visual evoked potentials, thought to originate in specific structures of these systems, were recorded in 286 normal subjects ranging in age from 4 to 95 years. Analysis was primarily restricted to peak and interpeak latencies; visual evoked potential amplitudes were also analyzed. Major results and conclusions are: (1) 'Developmental' changes (that is, decreases in latency attributable to decreased conduction time in younger subjects) were not seen in the median nerve, in brain-stem auditory pathways, or in some portions of visual cortex. Small developmental changes were seen in the somatosensory afferent pathway from the cervical spinal cord to thalamus, and large changes were seen in somatosensory and visual cortex. Cortical developmental changes appeared not to be complete until 17 years of age or later. (2) 'Aging' changes (that is, increases in latency attributable to increased conduction time in older subjects) were observed in the median nerve, cervical spinal cord, brain-stem auditory pathways, and somatosensory and visual cortex. (3) Visual evoked potential amplitudes tended to decrease with age, particularly during development; amplitude and latency effects were dissimilar for most components. (4) Males tended to show larger aging effects than females. (5) The results suggest that age-related changes in human sensory systems are not uniform, but rather are different in specific portions of these systems, different at particular epochs of the life span, and stronger in males than in females.},

abstract = {Aging is associated with significant white matter deterioration and this deterioration is assumed to be at least partly a consequence of myelin degeneration. The present study investigated specific predictions of the myelodegeneration hypothesis using diffusion tensor tractography. This technique has several advantages over other methods of assessing white matter architecture, including the possibility of isolating individual white matter tracts and measuring effects along the whole extent of each tract. The study yielded three main findings. First, age-related white matter deficits increased gradually from posterior to anterior segments within specific fiber tracts traversing frontal and parietal, but not temporal cortex. This pattern inverts the sequence of myelination during childhood and early development observed in previous studies and lends support to a "last-in-first-out" theory of the white matter health across the lifespan. Second, both the effects of aging on white matter and their impact on cognitive performance were stronger for radial diffusivity (RD) than for axial diffusivity (AD). Given that RD has previously been shown to be more sensitive to myelin integrity than AD, this second finding is also consistent with the myelodegeneration hypothesis. Finally, the effects of aging on select white matter tracts were associated with age difference in specific cognitive functions. Specifically, FA in anterior tracts was shown to be primarily associated with executive tasks and FA in posterior tracts mainly associated with visual memory tasks. Furthermore, these correlations were mirrored in RD, but not AD, suggesting that RD is more sensitive to age-related changes in cognition. Taken together, the results help to clarify how age-related white matter decline impairs cognitive performance. Published by Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is an exciting new MRI modality that can reveal detailed anatomy of the white matter. DTI also allows us to approximate the 3D trajectories of major white matter bundles. By combining the identified tract coordinates with various types of MR parameter maps, such as T-2 and diffusion properties, we can perform tract-specific analysis of these parameters. Unfortunately, 3D tract reconstruction is marred by noise, partial volume effects, and complicated axonal structures. Furthermore, changes in diffusion anisotropy under pathological conditions could alter the results of 3D tract reconstruction. In this study, we created a white matter parcellation atlas based on probabilistic maps of 11 major white matter tracts derived from the DTI data from 28 normal subjects. Using these probabilistic maps, automated tract-specific quantification of fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity were performed. Excellent correlation was found between the automated and the individual tractography-based results. This tool allows efficient initial screening of the status of multiple white matter tracts.

Using a forced-choice saccade task we show here that when two scenes are simultaneously flashed in the left and right hemifields, human participants can reliably make saccades to the side containing an animal in as little as 120ms. Low level differences between target and distractor images were unable to account for these exceptionally fast responses. The results suggest a very fast and unexpected route linking visual processing in the ventral stream with the programming of saccadic eye movements.},

abstract = {A series of analyses of variance on target search times allowed Fisk and Rogers (1991) to reject the null hypothesis that age had a uniform, additive effect across search conditions. It does not, however, follow that age affected some conditions in an exceptional way, as Fisk and Rogers concluded. Age may have had a uniform but nonadditive effect across conditions. In this article, it is shown that age had a uniform linear, or perhaps slightly curvilinear, effect on search times. This "null hypothesis" adequately accounted for the age effects in all 27 search conditions. Indeed, it accounted for the age effects in 107 conditions abstracted from other visual search studied and for the age effects in 154 conditions abstracted from a miscellaneous collection of nonsearch processing-time studies. The only variation in age outcomes across studies was consistent with sampling error, given the known variance in response times. It is concluded that age is experienced as a generalized slowing of the central nervous system uniformly affecting all information processes.},

abstract = {In this chapter, I show how multilevel mechanistic explanations scaffold the unity of neuroscience. Philosophers of neuroscience traditionally envision the unity of neuroscience as being achieved through the stepwise reduc- tion of higher-level theories to successively lower level, and ultimately fundamental, theories. I argue, in contrast, that the unity of neuroscience is achieved as different fields integrate their research by adding constraints on multilevel mechanistic explanations. The goal of finding multilevel explanations provides an abstract sketch or scaffold for integrating fields. The findings in different fields of neuroscience are used, like the tiles of a mosaic, to elaborate this abstract mechanism and to shape the space of possible mechanisms. The mosaic unity of neuroscience is achieved both through interfield integration at a given level and through integration across levels in a hierarchy of mechanisms. I develop this model using a putative exemplar ofreduction in contemporary neuroscience: the relation- ship between the psychological phenomena oflearning and memory and the electrophysiological phenomenon, Long-Term Potentiation (LTP). I thereby demonstrate that the mosaic view is superior to reduction as a model of the unity of neuroscience.},

abstract = {The majority of the research related to visual recognition has so far focused on bottom-up analysis, where the input is processed in a cascade of cortical regions that analyze increasingly complex information. Gradually more studies emphasize the role of top-down facilitation in cortical analysis, but it remains something of a mystery how such processing would be initiated. After all, top-down facilitation implies that high-level information is activated earlier than some relevant lower-level information. Building on previous studies, I propose a specific mechanism for the activation of top-down facilitation during visual object recognition. The gist of this hypothesis is that a partially analyzed version of the input image (i.e., a blurred image) is projected rapidly from early visual areas directly to the prefrontal cortex (PFC). This coarse representation activates in the PFC expectations about the most likely interpretations of the input image, which are then back-projected as an "initial guess" to the temporal cortex to be integrated with the bottom-up analysis. The top-down process facilitates recognition by substantially limiting the number of object representations that need to be considered. Furthermore, such a rapid mechanism may provide critical information when a quick response is necessary.},

abstract = {The morphology of the human cortex varies remarkably across individuals, regardless of overall brain size. It is currently unclear whether related cortical regions covary in gray matter density, as a result of mutually trophic influences or common experience-related plasticity. We acquired a structural magnetic resonance imaging scan from 172 subjects and extracted the regional gray matter densities from 12 readily identifiable regions of interest involved in sensorimotor or higher-order cognitive functions. We then used these values to predict regional densities in the remaining areas of the cortex, using voxel-based morphometry. This revealed patterns of positive and negative covariance that provide insight into the topographical organization of multiple cortical regions. We report that the gray matter density of a region is a good predictor of the density of the homotopic region in the contralateral hemisphere, with the striking exception of primary visual cortex. Whereas some regions express patterns of regional covariance that are mirror symmetrical relative to the interhemispheric fissure, other regions express asymmetric patterns of regional covariance. Finally, patterns of covariance are remarkably consistent between males and females, with the exception of the left amygdala, which is positively associated with the left and right anterior inferior temporal cortex in males and with the right angular gyrus in females. Our study establishes that the density of different cortical regions is coordinated within an individual. The coordinated variations we report are likely to be determined by both genetic and environmental factors and may be the basis for differences in individual behavior.},

abstract = {The use of Brinley plots (the plotting of the mean response latencies of old adults against the mean latencies for younger adults) has recently become increasingly popular, not least because simple, coherent functions can be determined that account for a large proportion of the variance in performance across tasks. This has led some authors to question the need for a modular approach to cognitive aging and has led to attempts to replace such an approach with accounts based on global central nervous system factors. However, use of simulated data to test the efficacy of Brinley plots shows that their apparent success in predicting high levels of variance may be misleading in two ways: (a) Brinley type plots fail to detect occasions when data are generated specifically not to conform to a single function; and (b) the parameter values obtained differ significantly from the underlying functions used to generate the test data. It is suggested that high correlations between young and old reaction times across tasks that have been widely reported in the literature are not in themselves sufficient to support the strong claims made regarding global models of cognitive aging.},

abstract = {This is the first comprehensive synthesis and general implications of the two-factor theory of cognitive abilities, which states that when the "tetrad difference" (between the cross-products in a rectangle of coefficients between four abilities) does not depart significantly (as judged in the light of its probable error) from zero, these abilities may be separated (mathematical proof is presented in the appendix) into a general factor g, common to all the abilities, and special factors s, appertaining to each separately. After several historical and critical chapters opposing the general-ability ("monarchic"), faculty or type ("oligarchic"), and average or general-level ("anarchic") concepts of cognition, the sequelae of the tetrad equation are explored. This is accurately satisfied by a majority of mental-test abilities, but not by physical measurements, etc. In cases where agreement is not close due to overlapping s's ("group factors") further inquiry brings to light other general factors besides g, such as c, the obverse of mental inertia or perseveration, "oscillation," apparently a fatigue function, and w, a semi-temperamental function akin to volition. The s's which remain are believed to be related to the particular sensory or motor apparatus involved--the "engines" in which g, the quantity of "energy" (of which the inertia and oscillation are also attributes) is expressed. The "engineer" is a requirement of the system to which the conative w concept seems to be fitted. Several chapters show the applicability of the two-factor concept to the elements of the author's analysis of cognition, such as education, clearness and speed, span, etc.; retentivity, however, was found to be independent of g.

abstract = {Nerve conduction velocity (NCV), the speed at which impulses travel along nerves, has been extensively determined in human peripheral nerves because of its clinical utility. In contrast, almost no studies have been made of human brain NCV. We determined brain NCVs in the visual nerve pathway for 185 male and 200 female university students ages 18-25 years. In each of three independent test conditions, we found that the mean NCV of male students is about 4\% faster than in females (P < or = 0.0001 for each condition). These male students also have a shorter reaction time in each of seven different RT tests than do females, even though, on the null hypothesis of equal NCVs, we would expect males to have longer RT times because of their greater physical size. Four of these comparisons are significant at or below the 0.001 level. These males also increase their NCVs with increasing age, in contrast to females. These sex differences in NCV parallel reported sex differences in age changes in white matter in the brain. These age changes may largely explain these NCV differences.},

@article{Reutskiy2003__conduction_in_bundles,
abstract = {This study presents a model of action potential propagation in bundles of myelinated nerve fibers. The model combines the single-cable formulation of Goldman and Albus (1967) with a basic representation of the ephaptic interaction among the fibers. We analyze first the behavior of the conduction velocity (CV) under the change of the various conductance parameters and temperature. The main parameter influencing the CV is the fast sodium conductance, and the dependence of CV on the temperature is linear up to 30 degrees C. The increase of myelin thickness above its normal value (5 microm) gives a slight increase in CV. The CV of the single fiber decreases monotonically with the disruption of myelin, but the breakdown is abrupt. There is always conduction until the thickness is larger than 2\% of its original value, at which with at this point a sharp transition of CV to zero occurs. Also, the increase of temperature can block conduction. At 5\% of the original thickness there is still spike propagation, but an increase of 2 degrees C causes conduction block. These results are consistent with clinical observations. Computer simulations are performed to show how the CV is affected by local damage to the myelin sheath, temperature alterations, and increased ephaptic coupling (i.e., coupling of electrical origin due to the electric neutrality of all the nerve) in the case of fiber bundles. The ephaptic interaction is included in the model. Synchronous impulse transmission and the formation of "condensed" pulse states are found. Electric impulses with a delay of 0.5 ms are presented to the system, and the numerical results show that, for increasing coupling, the impulses tend to adjust their speed and become synchronized. Other interesting phenomena are that spurious spikes are likely to be generated when ephaptic interaction is raised and that damaged axons suffering conduction block can be brought into conduction by the normal functioning fibers surrounding them. This is seen also in the case of a large number of fibers (N=500). When all the fibers are stimulated simultaneously, the conduction velocity is found to be strongly dependent on the level of ephaptic coupling and a sensible reduction is observed with respect to the propagation along an isolated axon even for low coupling level. As in the case of three fibers, spikes tend to lock and form collective impulses that propagate slowly in the nerve. On the other hand, if only 10\% of fibers are stimulated by an external input, the conduction velocity is only 2\% less than that along a single axon. We found a threshold value for the ephaptic coupling such that for lower values it is impossible to recruit the damaged fibers into conduction, for values of the coupling equal to this threshold only one fiber can be restored by the nondamaged fibers, and for values larger than the threshold an increasing number of fibers can return to normal functioning. We get values of the ephaptic coupling such that 25\% of axons can be damaged without change of the collective conduction.},

@article{Jirsa1997,
abstract = {The purpose of this paper is twofold: First, we present a semi-quantitative nonlinear field theory of the brain under realistic anatomical connectivity conditions describing the interaction between functional units within the brain. This macroscopic field theory is derived from the quasi microscopic conversion properties of neural populations occurring at synapses and somas. The quasi-microscopic models by Wilson-Cowan (1972,1973) and Nunez (1974) can be derived from these. Functional units are treated as inhomogeneities within a nonlinear one-dimensional neural tissue. Second, for the case of the Kelso experiment the field equation is treated analytically and numerically and can be reduced to a set of ordinary differential equations which corresponds to a model by Jirsa et al. (1994,1995). This phenomenological model reproduces the spatio-temporal phenomena experimentally observed. Here the most prominent property of the neural tissue is the parametric excitation. The macroscopic field parameters can be expressed by quasi-microscopic neural parameters.},

By formulating a master stability equation for time-delayed networks of Hindmarsh-Rose neurons, we show that there is always an extended region of stable synchronous activity corresponding to low coupling strengths. Such synchrony could be achieved in the undelayed system only by much higher coupling strengths. This phenomenon of enhanced neural synchrony by delay has important implications, in particular, in understanding synchronization of distant neurons and information processing in the brain.},

The internodally focally demyelinated cases (termed as IFD1, IFD2 and IFD3, respectively, with one, two and three demyelinated internodes are simulated using our previous double cable model of the fibre. The progressively greater increase of focal loss of myelin lamellae blocks the invasion of the intracellular potentials into the demyelinated zones. For all investigated cases, the radial decline of the extracellular potential amplitudes increases with the increase of the radial distance and demyelination, whereas the electrotonic potentials show a decrease in the slow part of the depolarizing and hyperpolarizing responses. The time constants are shorter and the rheobases higher for the IFD2 and IFD3 cases than for the normal case. In the recovery cycles, the same cases have less refractoriness, greater supernormality and less late subnormality than the normal case. The simulated membrane abnormalities can be observed in vivo in patients with demyelinating forms of Guillain-Barre syndrome.

This article presents one approach that has been used in functional imaging.This article reviews the basic distinction between functional and effective connectivity (as the terms are used in neuroimaging) and their role in addressing several aspects of functional organization (e.g. the topography of distributed system, integration between cortical areas, time-dependent changes in connectivity and nonlinear interactions). Emphasis is placed on the points of contact between the apparently diverse applications of these concepts and in particular the central role of eigenimages or spatial modes. Although the framework that has been developed is inherently linear, it has been extended to assess nonlinear interactions among cortical areas. 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {Whereas neuronal numbers are largely preserved in normal aging, subtle morphological changes occur in dendrites and spines, whose electrotonic consequences remain unexplored. We examined age-related morphological alterations in 2 types of pyramidal neurons contributing to working memory circuits in the macaque prefrontal cortex (PFC): neurons in the superior temporal cortex forming "long" projections to the PFC and "local" projection neurons within the PFC. Global dendritic mass homeostasis, measured by 3-dimensional scaling analysis, was conserved with aging in both neuron types. Spine densities, dendrite diameters, lengths, and branching complexity were all significantly reduced in apical dendrites of long projection neurons with aging, but only spine parameters were altered in local projection neurons. Despite these differences, voltage attenuation due to passive electrotonic structure, assuming equivalent cable parameters, was significantly reduced with aging in the apical dendrites of both neuron classes. Confirming the electrotonic analysis, simulated passive backpropagating action potential efficacy was significantly higher in apical but not basal dendrites of old neurons. Unless compensated by changes in passive cable parameters, active membrane properties, or altered synaptic properties, these effects will increase the excitability of pyramidal neurons, compromising the precisely tuned activity required for working memory, ultimately resulting in age-related PFC dysfunction.},

These relations remain significant after controlling for socioeconomic variables. One possible, partial explanation of these results is that intelligence enhances individuals' care of their own health because it represents learning, reasoning, and problem-solving skills useful in preventing chronic disease and accidental injury and in adhering to complex treatment regimens.},

abstract = {The understanding of the structural and dynamic complexity of mammalian brains is greatly facilitated by computer simulations. We present here a detailed large-scale thalamocortical model based on experimental measures in several mammalian species. The model spans three anatomical scales. (i) It is based on global (white-matter) thalamocortical anatomy obtained by means of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of a human brain. (ii) It includes multiple thalamic nuclei and six-layered cortical microcircuitry based on in vitro labeling and three-dimensional reconstruction of single neurons of cat visual cortex. (iii) It has 22 basic types of neurons with appropriate laminar distribution of their branching dendritic trees. The model simulates one million multicompartmental spiking neurons calibrated to reproduce known types of responses recorded in vitro in rats. It has almost half a billion synapses with appropriate receptor kinetics, short-term plasticity, and long-term dendritic spike-timing-dependent synaptic plasticity (dendritic STDP). The model exhibits behavioral regimes of normal brain activity that were not explicitly built-in but emerged spontaneously as the result of interactions among anatomical and dynamic processes. We describe spontaneous activity, sensitivity to changes in individual neurons, emergence of waves and rhythms, and functional connectivity on different scales.},

abstract = {Spatially continuous networks with heterogeneous connections are ubiquitous in biological systems, in particular neural systems. To understand the mutual effects of locally homogeneous and globally heterogeneous connectivity, we investigate the stability of the steady state activity of a neural field as a function of its connectivity. The variation of the connectivity is implemented through manipulation of a heterogeneous two-point connection embedded into the otherwise homogeneous connectivity matrix and by variation of the connectivity strength and transmission speed. Detailed examples including the Ginzburg-Landau equation and various other local architectures are discussed. Our analysis shows that developmental changes such as the myelination of the cortical large-scale fiber system generally result in the stabilization of steady state activity independent of the local connectivity. Non-oscillatory instabilities are shown to be independent of any influences of time delay. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Anisotropic water diffusion in neural fibres such as nerve, white matter in spinal cord, or white matter in brain forms the basis for the utilization of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to track fibre pathways. The fact that water diffusion is sensitive to the underlying tissue microstructure provides a unique method of assessing the orientation and integrity of these neural fibres, which may be useful in assessing a number of neurological disorders. The purpose of this review is to characterize the relationship of nuclear magnetic resonance measurements of water diffusion and its anisotropy (i.e. directional dependence) with the underlying microstructure of neural fibres. The emphasis of the review will be on model neurological systems both in vitro and in vivo. A systematic discussion of the possible sources of anisotropy and their evaluation will be presented followed by an overview of various studies of restricted diffusion and compartmentation as they relate to anisotropy. Pertinent pathological models, developmental studies and theoretical analyses provide further insight into the basis of anisotropic diffusion and its potential utility in the nervous system.

abstract = {An important issue in neuroscience is the characterization for the underlying architectures of complex brain networks. However, little is known about the network of anatomical connections in the human brain. Here, we investigated large-scale anatomical connection patterns of the human cerebral cortex using cortical thickness measurements from magnetic resonance images. Two areas were considered anatomically connected if they showed statistically significant correlations in cortical thickness and we constructed the network of such connections using 124 brains from the International Consortium for Brain Mapping database. Significant short- and long-range connections were found in both intra- and interhemispheric regions, many of which were consistent with known neuroanatomical pathways measured by human diffusion imaging. More importantly, we showed that the human brain anatomical network had robust small-world properties with cohesive neighborhoods and short mean distances between regions that were insensitive to the selection of correlation thresholds. Additionally, we also found that this network and the probability of finding a connection between 2 regions for a given anatomical distance had both exponentially truncated power-law distributions. Our results demonstrated the basic organizational principles for the anatomical network in the human brain compatible with previous functional networks studies, which provides important implications of how functional brain states originate from their structural underpinnings. To our knowledge, this study provides the first report of small-world properties and degree distribution of anatomical networks in the human brain using cortical thickness measurements.},

abstract = {Temporal development of radicular demyelination was studied in male albino rats examined sequentially throughout the lifespan of the animals. The rats were perfusion-fixed with paraformaldehyde and glutaraldehyde and areas of their nervous system including the lumbar spinal roots, the spinal cord, and the peripheral sciatic nerve, were embedded in epoxy resin and submitted to microscopic examination in semithin and ultrathin sections. In addition, a vital fat stain, teasing of single nerve fibers, and estimates of axon diameter and fiber number were obtained. Degenerative changes occurred earlier in the distal portions of nerve fibers than in the spinal roots. The radicular lesion consisted of swelling of myelin and demyelination possibly secondary to shrinkage of axons, resulting in focal accumulation of lipid debris within the spinal roots of old rats. Although the causation of senile neuronal atrophy affecting rat peripheral neurons is not fully obvious, this condition may be exacerbated by such factors as pressure on the nerves and hypoactivity.},

abstract = {We analysed the activation profiles obtained by simulating invasion of an orthodromic action potential in eleven anterogradely filled and serially reconstructed terminal arbors of callosal axons originating and terminating in areas 17 and 18 of the adult cat. This was done in order to understand how geometry relates to computational properties of axons. In the simulation, conduction from the callosal midline to the first bouton caused activation latencies of 0.9 - 3.2 ms, compatible with published electrophysiological values. Activation latencies of the total set of terminal boutons varied across arbors between 0.3 and 2.7 ms. Arbors distributed boutons in tangentially segregated terminal columns spanning one or, more often, several layers. Individual columns of one axon were frequently activated synchronously or else within a few hundred microseconds of each other. Synchronous activation of spatially separate columns is achieved by: (i) long primary or secondary branches of similar calibre running nearly parallel to each other for several millimetres; (ii) variations in the calibre of branches serially fed to separate columns by the same primary or secondary branch; (iii) exchange of high-order or preterminal branches across columns. The long, parallel branches blatantly violate principles of axonal economy. Simulated alterations of the axonal arbors indicate that similar spatiotemporal patterns of activity could, in principle, be obtained by less axon-costly architectures. The structure of axonal arbors, therefore, may not be determined solely by the type of spatiotemporal activation profiles it achieves in the cortex but also by other constraints, in particular those imposed by developmental mechanisms.},

abstract = {The number, types, and distribution of distinct classes of axons and glia in four cerebral commissures of the adult rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) were determined using electron microscopic and immunocytochemical methods. The two neocortical commissures, the corpus callosum, and the anterior commissure contain small but cytologically distinct archicortical components: the hippocampal commissure, which lies ventral to the splenium of the corpus callosum, and the basal telencephalic commissure, which forms a small crescent at the anterior margin of the anterior commissure. Each archicortical pathway is delineated from the adjacent neocortical commissure by a glial capsule. The glia cells that form this border are immunoreactive with antisera directed against glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and issue long processes that form numerous desmosomal junctions with one another. Braids of these glial processes envelop axonal fascicles within the archicortical commissures. In contrast, the GFAP-positive cells of the corpus callosum and anterior commissure are randomly distributed cells with relatively short stellate processes that do not form boundaries around axon fascicles. Quantitative electron microscopic analysis reveals that approximately 60 million axons connect the two cerebral hemispheres: the corpus callosum contains 56.0 million +/- 3.8 million axons (n = 8), the anterior commissure contains 3.15 million +/- 0.24 million axons (n = 8), the hippocampal commissure has 237,000 axons +/- 31,000 (n = 6), and the basal telencephalic commissure has 193,000 axons +/- 28,000 (n = 5). The number of axons is not directly proportional to the cross-sectional area in any of the commissures because of variation in axonal composition. On the basis of an estimate of approximately 3 billion neurons in the monkey cortex (Shariff, '53), we estimate that between 2 and 3\% of all cortical neurons project to the opposite cerebral hemisphere. Subregions of the corpus callosum as well as each of the other commissures consist of characteristic subsets of five classes of axons and contain different proportions of myelinated to unmyelinated fibers. The largest myelinated axons and the smallest proportion of unmyelinated axons (approximately 6\%) are found in regions of the corpus callosum that carry projections from primary sensory cortices, whereas the smallest myelinated axons and largest proportion of unmyelinated axons (approximately 30\%) are found in regions of the corpus callosum that carry projections from association cortices. Axon composition in the anterior commissure is uniform and resembles that of callosal sectors that contain association projections.},

abstract = {Stability is an important dynamical property of complex systems and underpins a broad range of coherent self-organized behavior. Based on evidence that some neurological disorders correspond to linear instabilities, we hypothesize that stability constrains the brain's electrical activity and influences its structure and physiology. Using a physiologically-based model of brain electrical activity, we investigated the stability and dispersion solutions of networks of neuronal populations with propagation time delays and dendritic time constants. We find that stability is determined by the spectrum of the network's matrix of connection strengths and is independent of the temporal damping rate of axonal propagation with stability restricting the spectrum to a region in the complex plane. Time delays and dendritic time constants modify the shape of this region but it always contains the unit disk. Instabilities resulting from changes in connection strength initially have frequencies less than a critical frequency. For physiologically plausible parameter values based on the corticothalamic system, this critical frequency is approximately 10 Hz. For excitatory networks and networks with randomly distributed excitatory and inhibitory connections, time delays and non-zero dendritic time constants have no impact on network stability but do effect dispersion frequencies. Random networks with both excitatory and inhibitory connections can have multiple marginally stable modes at low delta frequencies.},

abstract = {Herein, the well-known cable equation for nonmyelinated axon model is extended analytically for myelinated axon formulation. The myelinated membrane conductivity is represented via the Fourier series expansion. The classical cable equation is thereby modified into a linear second order ordinary differential equation with periodic coefficients, known as Hill's equation. The general internal source response, expressed via repeated convolutions, uniformly converges provided that the entire, periodic membrane is passive. The solution can be interpreted as an extended source response in an equivalent nonmyelinated axon (i.e., the response is governed by the classical cable equation). The extended source consists of the original source and a novel activation function, replacing the periodic membrane in the myelinated axon model. Mills equation is explicitly integrated for the specific choice of piecewise constant membrane conductivity profile, thereby resulting in an explicit closed form expression for the transmembrane potential in terms of trigonometric functions. The Floquet's modes are recognized as the nerve fiber activation modes, which are conventionally associated with the nonlinear Hodgkin-Huxley formulation. They can also be incorporated in our linear model, provided. that the periodic membrane point-wise passivity constraint is Properly modified. Indeed, the modified condition, enforcing the periodic membrane passivity constraint on the average conductivity only, leads, for the first time, to the inclusion of the nerve fiber activation modes in our novel model. The validity of the generalized transmission-line and cable equation models for a myelinated nerve fiber, is verified herein through a rigorous Green's function formulation and numerical simulations for transmembrane potential induced in three-dimensional myelinated cylindrical cell. It is shown that the dominant pole contribution of the exact modal expansion is the transmembrane potential solution of our generalized model.},

abstract = {The effects of aging on myelinated nerve fibers of the central nervous system are complex. Many myelinated nerve fibers in white matter degenerate and are lost, leading to some disconnections between various parts of the central nervous system. Other myelinated nerve fibers are affected differently, because only their sheaths degenerate, leaving the axons intact. Such axons are remyelinated by a series of internodes that are much shorter than the original ones and are composed of thinner sheaths. Thus the myelin-forming cells of the central nervous system, the oligodendrocytes, remain active during aging. Indeed, not only do these neuroglial cell remyelinate axons, with age they also continue to add lamellae to the myelin sheaths of intact nerve fibers, so that sheaths become thicker. It is presumed that the degeneration of myelin sheaths is due to the degeneration of the parent oligodendrocyte, and that the production of increased numbers of internodes as a consequence of remyelination requires additional oligodendrocytes. Whether there is a turnover of oligodendrocytes during life has not been studied in primates, but it has been established that over the life span of the monkey, there is a substantial increase in the numbers of oligodendrocytes. While the loss of some myelinated nerve fibers leads to some disconnections, the degeneration of other myelin sheaths and the subsequent remyelination of axons by shorter internodes slow down the rate conduction along nerve fibers. These changes affect the integrity and timing in neuronal circuits, and there is evidence that they contribute to cognitive decline.},

In both studies, NCV and RTs contributed significantly, in combination, to the prediction of full-scale IQ (shrunken multiple Rs = .53 and .57), but the expected pattern of causal relationships between the variables was not borne out. The results are interpreted in terms of a ''neural efficiency'' model of intelligence, which has received support from other studies of physiological correlates of human intelligence.},

abstract = {The pattern of remyelination after traumatic spinal cord injury remains elusive, with animal and human studies reporting partial to complete demyelination followed by incomplete remyelination. In the present study, we found that spared rubrospinal tract (RST) axons of passage traced with actively transported dextrans and examined caudally to the lesion 12 weeks after mouse spinal cord contusion injury were fully remyelinated. Spared axons exhibited a marginally reduced myelin thickness and significantly shorter internodes. CASPR (contactin-associated protein) and K(v)1.2 channels were used to identify internodes and paranodal protein distribution properties were used as an index of myelin integrity. This is the first time the CNS myelin internode length was measured in a mouse. To better understand the significance of shortened internodes and thinner myelin in spared axons, we modeled conduction properties using McIntyre's et al. model of myelinated axons. Mathematical modeling predicted a 21\% decrease in the conduction velocity of remyelinated RST axons attributable to shortened internodes. To determine whether demyelination could be present on axons exhibiting a pathological transport system, we used the retroviral reporter system. Virally delivered green fluorescent protein unveiled a small population of dystrophic RST axons that persist chronically with evident demyelination or abnormal remyelination. Collectively, these data show that lasting demyelination in spared axons is rare and that remyelination of axons of passage occurs in the chronically injured mouse spinal cord.},

@article{Izhikevich2006__polychronization,
abstract = {We present a minimal spiking network that can polychronize, that is, exhibit reproducible time-locked but not synchronous firing patterns with millisecond precision, as in synfire braids. The network consists of cortical spiking neurons with axonal conduction delays and spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP); a ready-to-use MATLAB code is included. It exhibits sleeplike oscillations, gamma (40 Hz) rhythms, conversion of firing rates to spike timings, and other interesting regimes. Due to the interplay between the delays and STDP, the spiking neurons spontaneously self-organize into groups and generate patterns of stereotypical polychronous activity. To our surprise, the number of coexisting polychronous groups far exceeds the number of neurons in the network, resulting in an unprecedented memory capacity of the system. We speculate on the significance of polychrony to the theory of neuronal group selection (TNGS, neural Darwinism), cognitive neural computations, binding and gamma rhythm, mechanisms of attention, and consciousness as "attention to memories.".},

abstract = {In the present pilot study, age-related white matter changes were investigated by the use of design-based stereological methods. In the brains of elderly subjects, the total volume of the white matter and the total volume of the myelinated fibers therein were lower than in those of young subjects (15\% and 17\%, respectively), but the differences were not statistically significant. The rotal length of the myelinated fibers of the white matter in the elderly group of 86,000 km was, statistically, significantly decreased by 27\% compared with 118,000 km in the young group. This loss of the total nerve fiber length was accompanied in particular by a decline of the myelinated fibers with a small diameter. The mean diameter of the myelinated fibers in the young group was significantly smaller than in the old group, but the relative size distributions of the myelinated fiber diameters between the young and old groups were similar. Our findings show that the atrophy of the human white matter during ageing is probably caused by a loss of myelinated fibers with a small diameter. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Inc.},

@article{Feldman1998c,
abstract = {In aged animal brains, a variety of "holes" are formed in the neuropil. One type of hole, here designated as the myelin balloon, is an abnormality of the myelin sheath and is found in a number of diverse sites in the brain. Profiles of myelin balloons display rather smoothly rounded peripheral contours and typically range up to 10 microm in diameter, although exceptionally large examples may be twice this size. The balloons are bounded by lamellae of myelin, and to accommodate the contents of the balloon, the myelin sheath becomes split at the intraperiod line. Since the intraperiod line is formed by the apposition of the outer faces of the myelin-forming plasma membrane, the contents of the myelin balloons are, in effect, in continuity with the extracellular space, and it is suggested that the contents of the balloons are fluid, with the fluid exerting an outward pressure on the walls of the balloons to produce their spherical shapes. Myelin balloons are not only produced during aging but also occur in a number of genetic strains of mice and in a number of human disease states. They thus represent a non-specific, though distinctive and common, alteration of the myelin sheath and are a reflection of the fact that under a variety of conditions, including normal aging, oligodendrocytes are unable to maintain the integrity of their sheaths.},

@article{Peters1996c,
abstract = {The rhesus monkey offers a useful model of normal human aging because when monkeys are tested on a battery of behavioral tasks that can also be used to evaluate cognition in humans, it is found that the monkeys undergo an age-related decline in several domains of cognitive function as do humans. In monkeys these changes begin at about 20 years of age. To determine what gives rise to this cognitive decline, we have examined several parameters in the brains of monkeys. Some parameters do not change with age. Examples of this are the numbers of neurons in the neocortex and hippocampal formation, and the numbers of synapses in the hippocampal formation. Changes in other parameters can be positively correlated with chronological age; examples of this are numbers of neuritic plaques, a decrease in the numbers of neurons in the striatally projecting pars compacta of the substantia nigra, and a decrease in the thickness of layer I in primary visual cortex. But the most interesting changes are those that correlate either with cognitive decline alone, or with both cognitive decline and chronological age. Among these are a breakdown in the integrity of myelin around axons, an overall reduction in the volume of white matter in the cerebral hemispheres, thinning of layer I in area 46 of prefrontal cortex, and decreases in the cell density in cortically projecting brain stem nuclei. To date then, our studies suggest that the cognitive declines evident in the rhesus monkey may be a consequence of changes in layer I and in the integrity of myelinated axons, rather than an age-related loss of cortical neurons or synapses, as has long been assumed.},

@article{Chiang2011__split_alphapeaks,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate age trends, sex differences, and splitting of alpha peaks of the EEG spectrum in the healthy population. METHODS: An automated multi-site algorithm was used to parametrize the alpha rhythm in 1498 healthy subjects aged 6-86 years. Alpha peaks identified from multiple electrode sites were organized into clusters of similar frequencies whose sex differences and age trends were investigated. RESULTS: Significant age-related trends were observed for frequency, position, and amplitude of dominant alpha peaks. Occipital sites had alpha clusters of higher average frequency, higher power, and greater presence across the scalp. Frequency and power differences were found between the sexes. CONCLUSION: Observed increases in alpha frequency in children and decreases in the elderly were consistent with those from earlier studies. A large fraction of participants ( approximately 44\%) showed multiple distinct alpha rhythm thus investigations which only examine the alpha frequency with the highest peak power can produce misleading results. The strong dependence of alpha frequency on age and anterior-posterior position indicates use of a fixed alpha frequency band is insufficient to capture the full characteristics of the alpha rhythm. SIGNIFICANCE: This study establishes alpha rhythm parameter ranges (including power and frequency) in the healthy population, and quantifies the variation in alpha frequency across the scalp. The automated characterization enables objective evaluations of alpha band activities over large samples. These findings are potentially useful in testing theories of alpha generation, where splitting of the alpha rhythm has been theoretically predicted to occur in individuals with large differences in axon length between anterior and posterior corticothalamic loops.},

@article{Ceballos1999,
abstract = {Qualitative and quantitative information is reported on the morphological changes that occur in nerve fibres and nonneuronal cells of peripheral nerve during the lifetime of the mouse. Tibial nerves of mice aged 6-33 mo were studied. With ageing, collagen accumulates in the perineurium and lipid droplets in the perineurial cells. Macrophages and mast cells increase in number, and onion bulbs and collagen pockets are frequently present. Schwann cells associated with myelinated fibres (MF) slightly decrease in number in parallel with an increase of the internodal length from 6 to 12 mo, but increase in older nerves when demyelination and remyelination are common. The unmyelinated axon to myelinated fibre (UA/MF) ratio was about 2 until 12 mo, decreasing to 1.6 by 27 mo. In older mice, the loss of nerve fibres involves UA (50\% loss of 27-33 mo cf. 6 mo) more markedly than MF (35\%). In aged nerves wide incisures and infolded or outfolded myelin loops are frequent, resulting in an increased irregularity in the morphology of fibres along the internodes. In the mouse there is an adult time period, 12-20 mo, during which several features of degeneration progressively appear, and an ageing period from 20 mo upwards when the nerve suffers a general disorganisation and marked fibre loss.},

abstract = {Human and non-human primates show cognitive decline during normal aging. Originally, the decline was attributed to a loss of cortical neurons, but recent studies have shown there is no significant cortical neuronal loss with age. Neurons acquire pigment, but the only other obvious changes are in layer I of neocortex. Layer I becomes thinner as apical tufts of pyramidal cells lose branches, as well as synapses, and at the same time the glial limiting membrane thickens. How dendrites and synapses in deep layers are affected by age is uncertain, but there are decreases in the levels of some neurotransmitters and receptors. Throughout the brain myelin sheaths show signs of breakdown. This may contribute to cognitive decline because it would cause a slowing of conduction along nerve fibers, disrupting the timing in neuronal circuits. Concomitantly, the myelin-forming oligodendrocytes develop swellings along their processes and gain dense inclusions. Microglial cells and astrocytes accumulate large amounts of phagocytosed material with age, although the origins of this material are not known. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Functional homotopy, the high degree of synchrony in spontaneous activity between geometrically corresponding interhemispheric (i.e., homotopic) regions, is a fundamental characteristic of the intrinsic functional architecture of the brain. However, despite its prominence, the lifespan development of the homotopic resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) of the human brain is rarely directly examined in functional magnetic resonance imaging studies. Here, we systematically investigated age-related changes in homotopic RSFC in 214 healthy individuals ranging in age from 7 to 85 years. We observed marked age-related changes in homotopic RSFC with regionally specific developmental trajectories of varying levels of complexity. Sensorimotor regions tended to show increasing homotopic RSFC, whereas higher-order processing regions showed decreasing connectivity (i.e., increasing segregation) with age. More complex maturational curves were also detected, with regions such as the insula and lingual gyrus exhibiting quadratic trajectories and the superior frontal gyrus and putamen exhibiting cubic trajectories. Sex-related differences in the developmental trajectory of functional homotopy were detected within dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Brodmann areas 9 and 46) and amygdala. Evidence of robust developmental effects in homotopic RSFC across the lifespan should serve to motivate studies of the physiological mechanisms underlying functional homotopy in neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders.},

abstract = {Although remyelination of demyelinated CNS axons is known to occur after transplantation of exogenous glial cells, previous studies have not determined whether cell transplantation can restore the conduction properties of demyelinated axons in the adult CNS. To examine this issue, the dorsal columns of the adult rat spinal cord were demyelinated by x-irradiation and intraspinal injections of ethidium bromide. Cell suspensions of cultured astrocytes and Schwann cells derived from neonatal rats transfected with the (beta-galactosidase) reporter gene were injected into the glial-free lesion site. After 3-4 weeks nearly all of the demyelinated axons were remyelinated by the transplanted Schwann cells. The dorsal columns were removed and maintained in an in vitro recording chamber; conduction properties were studied using field potential and intra-axonal recording techniques. The demyelinated axons exhibited conduction slowing and block, and a reduction in their ability to follow high-frequency stimulation. Axons remyelinated by transplantation of cultured Schwann cells exhibited restoration of conduction through the lesion, with reestablishment of normal conduction velocity. The axons remyelinated after transplantation showed enhanced impulse recovery to paired-pulse stimulation and greater frequency-following capability as compared with both demyelinated and control axons. These results demonstrate the functional repair of demyelinated axons in the adult CNS by transplantation of cultured myelin-forming cells from the peripheral nervous system in combination with astrocytes.},

abstract = {To determine standards of normality for auditory, somatosensory and visual evoked potentials commonly used in the assessment of neurological disease, 8 AEP, 1 VEP and 12 SEP components were recorded to stimulation of left and right ears, eyes, and median nerves in 286 normal subjects ranging in age from 4 to 95 years. Peak and interpeak latencies, and left-right differences in latency, were analyzed as a function of age, sex, and estimates of brain and body size. Major features of the results were: (1) Peak latencies of all components showed statistically significant increases in latency with age except that VEP P100 latency decreased significantly between 4 and 19 years and did not change between 20 and 59 years. (2) In adults the peak latencies of all components were significantly later in males than in females. For AEPs and VEPs these differences were explained by sex differences in brain size, and for adult SEPs were explained by sex differences in arm and shoulder dimensions. No significant sex differences in VEP and SEP latencies were seen in children. (3) Most interpeak latencies showed significant differences in relation to age or sex. (4) Age and sex are useful predictors of latency for nearly all peak and interpeak latencies; in addition, height is a useful predictor of SEP peak latencies. (5) Left-right latency differences showed little age-related, and no sex-related, change. The interlaboratory use of these or other normative data was discussed. It was concluded that these AEP and SEP norms can probably be used in other laboratories if stimulating and recording conditions are similar. However, VEP results are difficult to transfer due to the poorly understood effects of variation in stimulus conditions. Some issues regarding the optimal characterization of norms were also discussed.},

abstract = {This study examined the contributions of genetic and environmental factors to the observed correlation between intelligence test scores and speed of information processing, based on data for same-sex adult twin pairs (age, 15-57). Verbal and performance IQ scores from the Multidimensional Abilities Battery, as well as 11 reaction-time measures derived from a battery of information-processing tasks, were available for 50 monozygotic and 32 dizygotic pairs of twins. Multivariate biometrical analyses were used to estimate genetic and environmental parameters underlying observed variances and covariances among intelligence test scores and a general speed of information-processing factor (based on a linear composite of the 11 reaction-time scores). A common-factor model with loadings on general speed of processing, verbal IQ, and performance IQ fit the data well. The common factor was influenced primarily by additive genetic effects, such that the observed relationships among the speed and IQ measures are mediated entirely by hereditary factors. There was additional specific genetic variance for Verbal IQ and specific shared-twin environmental variance for Performance IQ. However, twin similarity for general speed of processing was explained entirely by genetic factors related to intelligence. The results emphasize the importance of common, heritable, biological mechanisms underlying the speed-IQ association.},

abstract = {The diameter of a myelinated nerve axon is directly proportional to its conduction velocity, so the axon diameter distribution helps determine the channel capacity of nervous transmission along fascicles in the central (CNS) and peripheral nervous systems (PNS). Previously, this histological information could only be obtained using invasive tissue biopsies. Here we propose a new NMR-based approach that employs a model of water diffusion within "restricted" cylindrical axons to estimate their diameter distribution within a nerve bundle. This approach can be combined with MRI to furnish an estimate of the axon diameter distribution within each voxel. This method is validated by comparing the diameter distributions measured using the NMR and histological techniques on sciatic and optic nerve tissue specimens. The axon diameter distribution measured in each voxel of porcine spinal cord using MRI and using histological methods were similar. Applications are expected in longitudinal studies designed to follow nerve growth in normal and abnormal development, as well as in diagnosing disorders and diseases affecting specific populations of axons in the CNS and PNS.},

abstract = {Age-associated memory impairment (AAMI) occurs in many mammalian species, including humans. In contrast to Alzheimer's disease (AD), in which circuit disruption occurs through neuron death, AAMI is due to circuit and synapse disruption in the absence of significant neuron loss and thus may be more amenable to prevention or treatment. We have investigated the effects of aging on pyramidal neurons and synapse density in layer III of area 46 in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of young and aged, male and female rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) that were tested for cognitive status through the delayed non-matching-to-sample (DNMS) and delayed response tasks. Cognitive tests revealed an age-related decrement in both acquisition and performance on DNMS. Our morphometric analyses revealed both an age-related loss of spines (33\%, p < 0.05) on pyramidal cells and decreased density of axospinous synapses (32\%, p < 0.01) in layer III of area 46. In addition, there was an age-related shift in the distribution of spine types reflecting a selective vulnerability of small, thin spines, thought to be particularly plastic and linked to learning. While both synapse density and the overall spine size average of an animal were predictive of number of trials required for acquisition of DNMS (i.e., learning the task), the strongest correlate of behavior was found to be the head volume of thin spines, with no correlation between behavior and mushroom spine size or density. No synaptic index correlated with memory performance once the task was learned.},

In an authoritative and critical account, Professor Ian Dreary reviews historical, cognitive, and biological research on the foundations of human mental ability. Where most previous accounts of intelligence have examined how human mental ability can predict success in education, work, and social life, few books have taken as a starting point mental ability (and individual differences in intelligence), and attempted to see what factors could have influenced, and have even predicted mental ability. This book reveals what we know about the origins of intelligence. It describes research on genetic influences on intelligence, and evidence that has been obtained from biological studies, including examinations of 'brain size', event related potentials, and the recent profusion of studies involving functional brain imaging. Coupled with fascinating historical stories, the book provides a highly original and thought provoking guide to try and answer the age old question of why some people seem more clever than others.},

The units correspond to individual neurons, neuronal populations, or anatomically segregated brain regions. The connectivity pattern is formed by structural links such as synapses or fiber pathways, or it represents statistical or causal relationships measured as cross-correlations, coherence, or information flow. Neural activity, and by extension neural codes, are constrained by connectivity. Brain connectivity is thus crucial to elucidating how neurons and neural networks process information.},

abstract = {A neuronal network inspired by the anatomy of the cerebral cortex was simulated to study the self-organization of spiking neurons into neuronal groups. The network consisted of 100 000 reentrantly interconnected neurons exhibiting known types of cortical firing patterns, receptor kinetics, short-term plasticity and long-term spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), as well as a distribution of axonal conduction delays. The dynamics of the network allowed us to study the fine temporal structure of emerging firing patterns with millisecond resolution. We found that the interplay between STDP and conduction delays gave rise to the spontaneous formation of neuronal groups - sets of strongly connected neurons capable of firing time-locked, although not necessarily synchronous, spikes. Despite the noise present in the model, such groups repeatedly generated patterns of activity with millisecond spike-timing precision. Exploration of the model allowed us to characterize various group properties, including spatial distribution, size, growth, rate of birth, lifespan, and persistence in the presence of synaptic turnover. Localized coherent input resulted in shifts of receptive and projective fields in the model similar to those observed in vivo.},

abstract = {To clarify the differences between the mechanisms of conduction slowing/block and accommodative processes in focal demyelinating neuropathies, this computational study presents the kinetics of the ionic, transaxonal and transmyelin currents defining the intracellular and electrotonic potentials in different segments of human motor nerve fibres. The computations use our previous double cable model of the fibres. The simulated fibres have focal demyelination of internodes, paranodes or both together. The intracellular potentials are defined mainly by the Na+ current, as the contribution of the K+ fast and K+ slow currents to the total nodal ionic current is negligible. The paranodal demyelinations cause an increase in the transaxonal current and a decrease in the transmyelin current at the paranodal segments. However, there is an inverse relationship between the transaxonal and transmyelin currents at the same segments in the cases of internodal demyelination. The internodal ionic channels beneath the myelin sheath do not contribute to the intracellular potentials, but they show a high sensitivity to long-lasting pulses. The slow components of the electrotonic potentials depend on the activation of the channel types in the nodal or internodal axolemma, whereas the fast components of the potentials are determined mainly by the passive cable responses. However, the current kinetics changes (defining the investigated electrotonic changes) are relatively weak. The study summarizes the results from these modelling investigations on the mechanisms underlying the conduction slowing/block and accommodative processes in focal demyelinating neuropathies such as Guillain-Barre syndrome and multifocal motor neuropathy.},

abstract = {Progress in functional neuroimaging of the brain increasingly relies on the integration of data from complementary imaging modalities in order to improve spatiotemporal resolution and interpretability. However, the usefulness of merely statistical combinations is limited, since neural signal sources differ between modalities and are related non-trivially. We demonstrate here that a mean field model of brain activity can simultaneously predict EEG and fMRI BOLD with proper signal generation and expression. Simulations are shown using a realistic head model based on structural MRI, which includes both dense short-range background connectivity and long-range specific connectivity between brain regions. The distribution of modeled neural masses is comparable to the spatial resolution of fMRI BOLD, and the temporal resolution of the modeled dynamics, importantly including activity conduction, matches the fastest known EEG phenomena. The creation of a cortical mean field model with anatomically sound geometry, extensive connectivity, and proper signal expression is an important first step towards the model-based integration of multimodal neuroimages.},

abstract = {Many variables have been assumed to reflect speed of processing, and most are strongly related to age in the period of adulthood. One of the primary theoretical questions with respect to aging and speed concerns the relative roles of specific and general age-related effects on particular speed variables. Distinguishing between specific (or unique) and general (or shared) age-related influences on measures of speed has been complicated, in part because the issues are sometimes framed in terms of extreme all-or-none positions, and because few researchers have employed analytical procedures suitable for estimating the relative contributions of each type of influence. However, recent methods focusing on partitioning age-related variance have indicated that large proportions of the age-related effects on individual speed variables are shared with age-related effects on other variables. Although these theoretical ideas and analytical procedures are fairly new, they may be relevant to a variety of psychophysiological or neurobiological variables.},

abstract = {Spatially continuous networks with heterogeneous connections are ubiquitous in biological systems, in particular neural systems. To understand the mutual effects of locally homogeneous and globally heterogeneous connectivity, we investigate the stability of the rest-state activity of a neural field as a function of its connectivity. The variation of the connectivity is operationalized through manipulation of a heterogeneous two-point connection embedded into the otherwise homogeneous connectivity matrix, as well as by variation of connectivity strength and a finite transmission speed. The latter results in a time delay of communication among individual brain areas. We demonstrate that the local connectivity generates the well-known power-law behaviour of the electroencephalographic power spectrum with an exponent close to -2, whereas the global connections generate a more characteristic line spectrum. These spectral characteristics are routinely observed in large-scale topographies of the human brain.},

abstract = {This article is concerned with measures of fit of a model. Two types of error involved in fitting a model are considered. The first is error of approximation which involves the fit of the model, with optimally chosen but unknown parameter values, to the population covariance matrix. The second is overall error which involves the fit of the model, with parameter values estimated from the sample, to the population covariance matrix. Measures of the two types of error are proposed and point and interval estimates of the measures are suggested. These measures take the number of parameters in the model into account in order to avoid penalizing parsimonious models. Practical difficulties associated with the usual tests of exact fit or a model are discussed and a test of "close fit" of a model is suggested.},

@article{Peters2002b,
abstract = {During normal aging humans exhibit some cognitive decline, but it is difficult to determine the underlying causes of this decline, because information about cognitive status is rarely available and preservation of the brain is usually inadequate for detailed cytological examination. One solution to this problem is to use a nonhuman primate model, such as the rhesus monkey, which exhibits age-related cognitive decline similar to humans, and can be cognitively tested before the brains are preserved for detailed examination. It is now known that cognitive decline in human and nonhuman primates is not due to loss of cortical neurons and there is no correlation between the frequency of senile plaques and cognitive status. Indeed apart from layer 1, neurons of cerebral cortex show few signs of aging, although there may be some loss of synapses throughout cortex. In contrast, both microglia and astrocytes come to contain phagocytosed material, but its origin is unknown. There is also loss of white matter, which is accompanied by some breakdown of myelin sheaths and alterations in oligodendrocytes. It is suggested that the myelin changes alter conduction velocities along axons. This would alter timing in neuronal circuits, contributing to cognitive decline.},

abstract = {It was believed that the cause of the cognitive decline exhibited by human and non-human primates during normal aging was a loss of cortical neurons. It is now known that significant numbers of cortical neurons are not lost and other bases for the cognitive decline have been sought. One contributing factor may be changes in nerve fibers. With age some myelin sheaths exhibit degenerative changes, such as the formation of splits containing electron dense cytoplasm, and the formation on myelin balloons. It is suggested that such degenerative changes lead to cognitive decline because they cause changes in conduction velocity, resulting in a disruption of the normal timing in neuronal circuits. Yet as degeneration occurs, other changes, such as the formation of redundant myelin and increasing thickness suggest of sheaths, suggest some myelin formation is continuing during aging. Another indication of this is that oligodendrocytes increase in number with age. In addition to the myelin changes, stereological studies have shown a loss of nerve fibers from the white matter of the cerebral hemispheres of humans, while other studies have shown a loss of nerve fibers from the optic nerves and anterior commissure in monkeys. It is likely that such nerve fiber loss also contributes to cognitive decline, because of the consequent decrease in connections between neurons. Degeneration of myelin itself does not seem to result in microglial cells undertaking phagocytosis. These cells are probably only activated when large numbers of nerve fibers are lost, as can occur in the optic nerve.},

abstract = {Full brain network models comprise a large-scale connectivity (the connectome) and neural mass models as the network's nodes. Neural mass models absorb implicitly a variety of properties in their constant parameters to achieve a reduction in complexity. In situations, where the local network connectivity undergoes major changes, such as in development or epilepsy, it becomes crucial to model local connectivity explicitly. This leads naturally to a description of neural fields on folded cortical sheets with local and global connectivities. The numerical approximation of neural fields in biologically realistic situations as addressed in Virtual Brain simulations (see http://thevirtualbrain.org/app/ (version 1.0)) is challenging and requires a thorough evaluation if the Virtual Brain approach is to be adapted for systematic studies of disease and disorders. Here we analyze the sampling problem of neural fields for arbitrary dimensions and provide explicit results for one, two and three dimensions relevant to realistically folded cortical surfaces. We characterize (i) the error due to sampling of spatial distribution functions; (ii) useful sampling parameter ranges in the context of encephalographic (EEG, MEG, ECoG and functional MRI) signals; (iii) guidelines for choosing the right spatial distribution function for given anatomical and geometrical constraints.},

abstract = {Tractography based on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) allows visualization of white matter tracts. In this study, protocols to reconstruct eleven major white matter tracts are described. The protocols were refined by several iterations of intra- and inter-rater measurements and identification of sources of variability. Reproducibility of the established protocols was then tested by raters who did not have previous experience in tractography. The protocols were applied to a DTI database of adult normal subjects to study size, fractional anisotropy (FA), and T-2 of individual white matter tracts. Distinctive features in FA and T-2 were found for the corticospinal tract and callosal fibers. Hemispheric asymmetry was observed for the size of white matter tracts projecting to the temporal lobe. This protocol provides guidelines for reproducible DTI-based tract-specific quantification. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

@article{Peters2002c,
abstract = {In the rhesus monkey, the myelin sheaths of nerve fibers in area 46 of prefrontal cortex and in splenium of the corpus callosum show age-related alterations in their structure. The alterations are of four basic types. Most common is splitting of the dense line of myelin sheaths to accommodate electron dense cytoplasm derived from the oligodendroglia. Less common are splits of the intraperiod line to form balloons or blisters that appear to contain fluid, the occurrence of sheaths with redundant myelin, and thick sheaths that are almost completely split so that one set of compact lamellae is surrounded by another set. But despite these alterations in the sheaths, few nerve fibers show axonal degeneration. To quantify the frequency of the age-related alterations in myelin, transversely sectioned nerve fibers from the splenium of the corpus callosum and from the vertical bundles of nerve fibers within area 46 were examined in electron photomicrographs. The material was taken from 19 monkeys, ranging between 5 and 35 years of age. It was found that the frequency of alterations in myelin sheaths from both locations correlates significantly with age. In area 46, the age-related alterations also significantly correlate (P < 0.001) with an overall assessment of impairment in cognition, i.e., the cognitive impairment index, displayed by individual monkeys. The correlation is also significant when only the old monkeys are considered as a group. A similar result was obtained previously in our examination of the effects of age on the myelin sheaths of nerve fibers in primary visual cortex (Peters et al. [2000] J Comp Neurol. 419:364-376). However, in the corpus callosum the myelin alterations correlate significantly with only one component of the cognitive impairment index, namely the delayed nonmatching to sample task with a 2-minute delay. It is proposed that age-related myelin alterations are ubiquitous and that the correlations between their frequency and impairments in cognition occur because the conduction velocity along the affected nerve fibers is reduced, so that the normal timing sequences within neuronal circuits break down.

abstract = {Recent studies with magnetic resonance imaging suggest that age-related changes in white matter during male adolescence may indicate an increase in g ratio wherein the radial growth of an axon outpaces a corresponding increase in myelin thickness. We review the original Rushton (1951) model where a g ratio of approximately 0.6 represents an optimal relationship between the axon and fibre diameters vis-\`{a}-vis conduction velocity, and point out evidence indicating slightly higher g ratio in large-diameter fibres. We estimate that fibres with a diameter larger than 9.6 mum will have a relatively thinner myelin sheath, and brains with increasingly larger proportions of such large-diameter fibres will have progressively lower concentration of myelin. We conclude by pointing out possible implications of "suboptimal" g ratio for the emergence of "disconnection" disorders, such as schizophrenia, in late adolescence.},
